      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y son,&rdquo; said The
      Macnamara with an air of grandeur, &ldquo;my son, you've forgotten what's due&rdquo;&mdash;he
      pronounced it &ldquo;jew&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to yourself, what's due to your father, what's
      due to your forefathers that bled,&rdquo; and The Macnamara waved his hand
      gracefully; then, taking advantage of its proximity to the edge of the
      table, he made a powerful but ineffectual attempt to pull himself to his
      feet. Finding himself baffled by the peculiar formation of his chair, and
      not having a reserve of breath to draw upon for another exertion, he
      concealed his defeat under a pretence of feeling indifferent on the matter
      of rising, and continued fingering the table-edge as if endeavouring to
      read the initials which had been carved pretty deeply upon the oak by a
      humorous guest just where his hand rested. &ldquo;Yes, my son, you've forgotten
      the blood of your ancient sires. You forget, my son, that you're the
      offspring of the Macnamaras and the O'Dermots, kings of Munster in the
      days when there were kings, and when the Geralds were walking about in
      blue paint in the woods of the adjacent barbarous island of Britain&rdquo;&mdash;The
      Macnamara said &ldquo;barbarious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Geralds have been at Suanmara for four hundred years,&rdquo; said Standish
      quickly, and in the tone of one resenting an aspersion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred years!&rdquo; cried The Macnamara scornfully. &ldquo;Four hundred years!
      What's four hundred years in the existence of a family?&rdquo; He felt that this
      was the exact instant for him to rise grandly to his feet, so once more he
      made the essay, but without a satisfactory result. As a matter of fact, it
      is almost impossible to release oneself from the embrace of a heavy oak
      chair when the seat has been formed of light cane, and this cane has
      become tattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care about the kings of Munster&mdash;no, not a bit,&rdquo; said
      Standish, taking a mean advantage of the involuntary captivity of his
      father to insult him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm dead sick hearing about them. They never did anything for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Macnamara threw back his head, clasped his hands over his bosom, and
      gazed up to the cobwebs of the oak ceiling. &ldquo;My sires&mdash;shades of the
      Macnamaras and the O'Dermots, visit not the iniquity of the children upon
      the fathers,&rdquo; he exclaimed. And then there came a solemn pause which the
      hereditary monarch felt should impress his son deeply; but the son was not
      deceived into fancying that his father was overcome with emotion; he knew
      very well that his father was only thinking how with dignity he could
      extricate himself from his awkward chair, and so he was not deeply
      affected. &ldquo;My boy, my boy,&rdquo; the father murmured in a weak voice, after his
      apostrophe to the shades of the ceiling, &ldquo;what do you mean to do? Keep
      nothing secret from me, Standish; I'll stand by you to the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to do anything. There is nothing to be done&mdash;at least&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you say? Nothing to be done? You don't mean to say you've
      been thrifling with the young-woman's affection? Never shall a son of
      mine, and the offspring of The Macnamaras and the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you put such a question to me?&rdquo; said the young man indignantly.
      &ldquo;I throw back the insinuation in your teeth, though you are my father. I
      would scorn to trifle with the feelings of any lady, not to speak of Miss
      Gerald, who is purer than the lily that blooms&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the valley of Shanganagh&mdash;that's what you said in the poem, my
      boy; and it's true, I'm sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But because you find a scrap of poetry in my writing you fancy that I
      forget my&mdash;my duty&mdash;my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty sires, Standish; say the word at once, man. Well, maybe I was too
      hasty, my boy; and if you tell me that you don't love her now, I'll
      forgive all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; cried the young man, with the vehemence of a mediaeval burning
      martyr. &ldquo;I swear that I love her, and that it would be impossible for me
      ever to think of any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is cruel&mdash;cruel!&rdquo; murmured The Macnamara, still thinking how he
      could extricate himself from his uneasy seat. &ldquo;It is cruel for a father,
      but it must be borne&mdash;it must be borne. If our ancient house is to
      degenerate to a Saxon's level, I'm not to blame. Standish, my boy, I
      forgive you. Take your father's hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out his hand, and the young man took it. The grasp of The
      Macnamara was fervent&mdash;it did not relax until he had accomplished the
      end he had in view, and had pulled himself to his feet. Standish was about
      to leave the room, when his father, turning his eyes away from the
      tattered cane-work of the chair, that now closely resembled the star-trap
      in a pantomime, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go yet, sir. This isn't to end here. Didn't you tell me that your
      affection was set upon this daughter of the Geralds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of continuing such questions?&rdquo; cried the young man
      impatiently. The reiteration by his father of this theme&mdash;the most
      sacred to Standish's ears&mdash;was exasperating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No son of mine will be let sneak out of an affair like this,&rdquo; said the
      hereditary monarch. &ldquo;We may be poor, sir, poor as a bogtrotter's dog&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we are,&rdquo; interposed Standish bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have still the memories of the grand old times to live upon, and
      the name of Macnamara was never joined with anything but honour. You love
      that daughter of the Geralds&mdash;you've confessed it; and though the
      family she belongs to is one of these mushroom growths that's springing up
      around us in three or four hundred years&mdash;ay, in spite of the upstart
      family she belongs to, I'll give my consent to your happiness. We mustn't
      be proud in these days, my son, though the blood of kings&mdash;eh, where
      do ye mean to be going before I've done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? well, you're mistaken. You don't stir from here until you've
      promised me to make all the amends in your power to this daughter of the
      Geralds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amends? I don't understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you tell me you love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The refrain which was so delightful to the young man's ears when he
      uttered it alone by night under the pure stars, sounded terrible when
      reiterated by his father. But what could he do&mdash;his father was now
      upon his feet?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of profaning her name in this fashion?&rdquo; cried Standish.
      &ldquo;If I said I loved her, it was only when you accused me of it and
      threatened to turn me out of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And out of the house you'll go if you don't give me a straightforward
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; cried Standish doggedly. &ldquo;What is there here that should
      make me afraid of your threat? I want to be turned out. I'm sick of this
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! what has come over the boy that he has taken to speaking like
      this? Are ye demented, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; said Standish. &ldquo;Only I have been thinking for the past
      few days over my position here, and I have come to the conclusion that I
      couldn't be worse off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been thinking, have you?&rdquo; asked The Macnamara contemptuously. &ldquo;You
      depart so far from the traditions of your family? Well, well,&rdquo; he
      continued in an altered tone, after a pause, &ldquo;maybe I've been a bad father
      to you, Standish, maybe I've neglected my duty; maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; here
      The Macnamara felt for his pocket-handkerchief, and having found it, he
      waved it spasmodically, and was about to throw himself into his chair when
      he recollected its defects and refrained, even though he was well aware
      that he was thereby sacrificing much of the dramatic effect up to which he
      had been working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father; I don't want to say that you have been anything but good to
      me, only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say it, my son,&rdquo; said The Macnamara, mopping his brows earnestly
      with his handkerchief. &ldquo;I've been a selfish old man, haven't I, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, anything but that. You have only been too good. You have given me
      all I ever wanted&mdash;except&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except what? Ah, I know what you mean&mdash;except money. Ah, your
      reproach is bitter&mdash;bitter; but I deserve it all, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father: I did not say that at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll show you, my boy, that your father can be generous once of a
      time. You love her, don't you, Standish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father had laid his hand upon his shoulder now, and spoke the words in
      a sentimental whisper, so that they did not sound so profane as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I worship the ground she treads on,&rdquo; his son answered, tremulous with
      eagerness, a girlish blush suffusing his cheeks and invading the curls
      upon his forehead, as he turned his head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll show you that I can be generous. You shall have her, Standish
      Macnamara; I'll give her to you, though she is one of the new families.
      Put on your hat, my boy, and come out with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going out?&rdquo; said Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, so order round the car, if the spring is mended. It should be, for
      I gave Eugene the cord for it yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standish made a slight pause at the door as if about to put another
      question to his father; after a moment of thoughtfulness, however, he
      passed out in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door had closed&mdash;or, at least, moved upon its hinges, for
      the shifting some years previously of a portion of the framework made its
      closing an impossibility&mdash;The Macnamara put his hands deep into his
      pockets, jingling the copper coins and the iron keys that each receptacle
      contained. It is wonderful what suggestions of wealth may be given by the
      judicious handling of a few coppers and a bunch of keys, and the
      imagination of The Macnamara being particularly sanguine, he felt that the
      most scrupulous moneylender would have offered him at that moment, on the
      security of his personal appearance and the sounds of his jingling metal,
      any sum of money he might have named. He rather wished that such a
      moneylender would drop in. But soon his thoughts changed. The jingling in
      his pockets became modified, resembling in tone an unsound peal of muffled
      bells; he shook his head several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Macnamara, my lad, you were too weak,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;You
      yielded too soon; you should have stood out for a while; but how could I
      stand out when I was sitting in that trap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned round glaring at the chair which he blamed as the cause of his
      premature relaxation. He seemed measuring its probable capacities of
      resistance; and then he raised his right foot and scrutinised the boot
      that covered it. It was not a trustworthy boot, he knew. Once more he
      glanced towards the chair, then with a sigh he put his foot down and
      walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past the window at this instant the car was moving, drawn by a
      humble-minded horse, which in its turn was drawn by a boy in a faded and
      dilapidated livery that had evidently been originally made for a
      remarkably tall man. The length of the garment, though undeniably
      embarrassing in the region of the sleeves, had still its advantages, not
      the least of which was the concealment of a large portion of the bare legs
      of the wearer; it was obvious too that when he should mount his seat, the
      boy's bare feet would be effectually hidden, and from a livery-wearing
      standpoint this would certainly be worth consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Macnamara gave a critical glance through the single transparent pane
      of the window&mdash;the pane had been honoured above its fellows by a
      polishing about six weeks before&mdash;and saw that the defective spring
      of the vehicle had been repaired. Coarse twine had been employed for this
      purpose; but as this material, though undoubtedly excellent in its way,
      and of very general utility, is hardly the most suitable for restoring a
      steel spring to its original condition of elasticity, there was a good
      deal of jerkiness apparent in the motion of the car, especially when the
      wheels turned into the numerous ruts of the drive. The boy at the horse's
      head was, however, skilful in avoiding the deeper depths, and the animal
      was also most considerate in its gait, checking within itself any unseemly
      outburst of spirit and restraining every propensity to break into a trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, father, I'm ready,&rdquo; said Standish, entering with his hat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Eugene brushed my hat?&rdquo; asked The Macnamara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My black hat, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you were going to wear it today, when you were only taking
      a drive,&rdquo; said Standish with some astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy, I'll wear the black hat, please God, so get it brushed; and
      tell him that if he uses the blacking-brush this time I'll have his life.&rdquo;
       Standish went out to deliver these messages; but The Mac-namara stood in
      the centre of the big room pondering over some weighty question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he muttered, as though a better impulse of his nature were in
      the act of overcoming an unworthy suggestion. &ldquo;Yes, I will; when I'm
      wearing the black hat things should be levelled up to that standard; yes,
      I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standish entered in a few minutes with his father's hat&mdash;a tall,
      old-fashioned silk hat that had at one time, pretty far remote, been
      black. The Macnamara put it on carefully, after he had just touched the
      edges with his coat-cuff to remove the least suspicion of dust; then he
      strode out followed by his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car was standing at the hall door, and Eugene the driver was beside
      it, giving a last look to the cordage of the spring. When The Macnamara,
      however, appeared, he sprang up and touched his forehead, with a smile of
      remarkable breadth. The Macnamara stood impassive, and in dignified
      silence, looking first at the horse, then at the car, and finally at the
      boy Eugene, while Standish remained at the other side. Eugene bore the
      gaze of the hereditary monarch pretty well on the whole, conscious of the
      abundance of his own coat. The scrutiny of The Macnamara passed gradually
      down the somewhat irregular row of buttons until it rested on the
      protruding bare feet of the boy. Then after another moment of impressive
      silence, he waved one hand gracefully towards the door, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugene, get on your boots.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN the head of a
      community has, after due deliberation, resolved upon the carrying out of
      any bold social step, he may expect to meet with the opposition that
      invariably obstructs the reformer's advance; so that one is tempted&mdash;nay,
      modern statesmanship compels one&mdash;to believe that secrecy until a
      projected design is fully matured is a wise, or at least an effective,
      policy. The military stratagem of a surprise is frequently attended with
      good results in dealing with an enemy, and as a friendly policy why should
      it not succeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, beyond a question, the course of thought pursued by The
      Macnamara before he uttered those words to Eugene. He had not given the
      order without careful deliberation, but when he had come to the conclusion
      that circumstances demanded the taking of so bold a step, he had not
      hesitated in his utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugene was indeed surprised, and so also was Standish. The driver took off
      his hat and passed his fingers through his hair, looking down to his bare
      feet, for he was in the habit of getting a few weeks of warning before a
      similar order to that just uttered by his master was given to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear, or are you going to wait till the horse has frozen to the
      sod?&rdquo; inquired The Macnamara; and this brought the mind of the boy out of
      the labyrinth of wonder into which it had strayed. He threw down the whip
      and the reins, and, tucking up the voluminous skirts of his coat, ran
      round the house, commenting briefly as he went along on the remarkable
      aspect things were assuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the kitchen from the rear, where an old man and two old women
      were sitting with short pipes alight, he cried, &ldquo;What's the world comin'
      to at all? I've got to put on me boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Saint Bridget,&rdquo; cried a pious old woman, &ldquo;he's to put on his
      brogues! An' is it The Mac has bid ye, Eugene?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra a sowl ilse. So just shake a coal in iviry fut to thaw thim a bit,
      alana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the old woman was performing this operation over the turf fire,
      there was some discussion as to what was the nature of the circumstances
      that demanded such an unusual proceeding on the part of The Macnamara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only The Mac himsilf that sames to know&mdash;. knock the ashes well
      about the hale, ma'am&mdash;for Masther Standish was as much put out as
      mesilf whin The Mac says&mdash;nivir moind the toes, ma'am, me fut'll
      nivir go more nor halfways up the sowl&mdash;says he, 'Git on yer boots;'
      as if it was the ordinarist thing in the world;&mdash;now I'll thry an'
      squaze me fut in.&rdquo; And he took the immense boot so soon as the fiery ashes
      had been emptied from its cavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mac's pride'll have a fall,&rdquo; remarked the old man in the corner
      sagaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't wondher,&rdquo; said Eugene, pulling on one of the boots. &ldquo;The
      spring is patched with hemp, but it's as loikely to give way as not&mdash;holy
      Biddy, ye've left a hot coal just at the instep that's made its way to me
      bone!&rdquo; But in spite of this catastrophe, the boy trudged off to the car,
      his coat's tails flapping like the foresail of a yacht brought up to the
      wind. Then he cautiously mounted his seat in front of the car, letting a
      boot protrude effectively on each side of the narrow board. The Macnamara
      and his son, who had exchanged no word during the short absence of Eugene
      in the kitchen, then took their places, the horse was aroused from its
      slumber, and they all passed down the long dilapidated avenue and through
      the broad entrance between the great mouldering pillars overclung with ivy
      and strange tangled weeds, where a gate had once been, but where now only
      a rough pole was drawn across to prevent the trespass of strange animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly pitiful it was to see such signs of dilapidation everywhere around
      this demesne of Innishdermot. The house itself was an immense, irregularly
      built, rambling castle. Three-quarters of it was in utter ruin, but it had
      needed the combined efforts of eight hundred years of time and a thousand
      of Cromwell's soldiers to reduce the walls to the condition in which they
      were at present. The five rooms of the building that were habitable
      belonged to a comparatively new wing, which was supported on the eastern
      side by the gable of a small chapel, and on the western by the wall of a
      great round tower which stood like a demolished sugar-loaf high above all
      the ruins, and lodged a select number of immense owls whose eyesight was
      so extremely sensitive, it required an unusual amount of darkness for its
      preservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the habitation of The Macnamaras, hereditary kings of Munster,
      and here it was that the existing representative of the royal family lived
      with his only son, Standish O'Dermot Macnamara. In front of the pile
      stretched a park, or rather what had once been a park, but which was now
      wild and tangled as any wood. It straggled down to the coastway of the
      lough, which, with as many windings as a Norwegian fjord, brought the
      green waves of the Atlantic for twenty miles between coasts a thousand
      feet in height&mdash;coasts which were black and precipitous and pierced
      with a hundred mighty caves about the headlands of the entrance, but which
      became wooded and more gentle of slope towards the narrow termination of
      the basin. The entire of one coastway, from the cliffs that broke the wild
      buffet of the ocean rollers, to the little island that lay at the
      narrowing of the waters, was the property of The Macnamara. This was all
      that had been left to the house which had once held sway over two hundred
      miles of coastway, from the kingdom of Kerry to Achill Island, and a
      hundred miles of riverway. Pasturages the richest of the world, lake-lands
      the most beautiful, mountains the grandest, woods and moors&mdash;all had
      been ruled over by The Macnamaras, and of all, only a strip of coastway
      and a ruined castle remained to the representative of the ancient house,
      who was now passing on a jaunting-car between the dilapidated pillars at
      the entrance to his desolate demesne.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a small hill that came in sight so soon as the car had passed from
      under the gaunt fantastic branches that threw themselves over the wall at
      the roadside, as if making a scrambling clutch at something indefinite in
      the air, a ruined tower stood out in relief against the blue sky of this
      August day. Seeing the ruin in this land of ruins The Macnamara sighed
      heavily&mdash;too heavily to allow of any one fancying that his emotion
      was natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my son, the times have changed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only a few years have
      passed&mdash;six hundred or so&mdash;since young Brian Macnamara left that
      very castle to ask the daughter of the great Desmond of the Lake in
      marriage. How did he go out, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that we are now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he go out?&rdquo; again asked The Macnamara, interrupting his son's
      words of astonishment. &ldquo;He went out of that castle with three hundred and
      sixty-five knights&mdash;for he had as many knights as there are days in
      the year.&rdquo;&mdash;Here Eugene, who only caught the phonetic sense of this
      remarkable fact regarding young Brian Macnamara, gave a grin, which his
      master detected and chastised by a blow from his stick upon the mighty
      livery coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; said Standish, after the trifling excitement occasioned by
      this episode had died away&mdash;&ldquo;but, father, we are surely not going&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, my son. The young Brian and his retinue went out one August day
      like this; and with him was the hundred harpers, the fifty pipers, and the
      thirteen noble chiefs of the Lakes, all mounted on the finest of steeds,
      and the morning sun glittering on their gems and jewels as if they had
      been drops of dew. And so they rode to the castle of Desmond, and when he
      shut the gates in the face of the noble retinue and sent out a haughty
      message that, because the young Prince Brian had slain The Desmond's two
      sons, he would not admit him as a suitor to his daughter, the noble young
      prince burnt The Desmond's tower to the ground and carried off the
      daughter, who, as the bards all agree, was the loveliest of her sex. Ah,
      that was a wooing worthy of The Mac-namaras. These are the degenerate days
      when a prince of The Macnamaras goes on a broken-down car to ask the hand
      of a daughter of the Geralds.&rdquo; Here a low whistle escaped from Eugene, and
      he looked down at his boots just as The Macnamara delivered another rebuke
      to him of the same nature as the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we're not going to&mdash;to&mdash;Suanmara!&rdquo; cried Standish in
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where are we going, maybe you'll tell me?&rdquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there&mdash;not there; you never said you were going there. Why
      should we go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for the same reason that your noble forefather Brian Macnamara went
      to the tower of The Desmond,&rdquo; said the father, leaving it to Standish to
      determine which of the noble acts of the somewhat impetuous young prince
      their present excursion was designed to emulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say, father, that&mdash;that&mdash;oh, no one could think
      of such a thing as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the hereditary monarch coolly, &ldquo;you made a confession to me
      this morning that only leaves me one course. The honour of The Macnamaras
      is at stake, and as the representative of the family it's my duty to
      preserve it untarnished. When a son of mine confesses his affection for a
      lady, the only course he can pursue towards her is to marry her, let her
      even be a Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't go on such a fool's errand,&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;She&mdash;her
      grandfather&mdash;they would laugh at such a proposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Desmond laughed, and what came of it, my boy?&rdquo; said the Macnamara
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go on any farther,&rdquo; cried Standish, unawed by the reference to
      the consequences of the inopportune hilarity of The Desmond. &ldquo;How could
      you think that I would have the presumption to fancy for the least moment
      that&mdash;that&mdash;she&mdash;that is&mdash;that they would listen to&mdash;to
      anything I might say? Oh, the idea is absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, I am the head of the line of The Munster Macnamaras, and the head
      always decides in delicate matters like this. I'll not have the feeling's
      of the lady trifled with even by a son of my own. Didn't you confess all
      to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go on,&rdquo; the young man cried again. &ldquo;She&mdash;that is&mdash;they
      will think that we mean an affront&mdash;and it is a gross insult to her&mdash;to
      them&mdash;to even fancy that&mdash;oh, if we were anything but what we
      are there would be some hope&mdash;some chance; if I had only been allowed
      my own way I might have won her in time&mdash;long years perhaps, but
      still some time. But now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recreant son of a noble house, have you no more spirit than a Saxon?&rdquo;
       said the father, trying to assume a dignified position, an attempt that
      the jerking of the imperfect spring of the vehicle frustrated. &ldquo;Mightn't
      the noblest family in Europe think it an honour to be allied with The
      Munster Macnamaras, penniless though we are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go to-day, father,&rdquo; said Standish, almost piteously; &ldquo;no, not
      to-day. It is too sudden&mdash;my mind is not made up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mine is, my boy. Haven't I prepared everything so that there can be
      no mistake?&rdquo;&mdash;here he pressed his tall hat more firmly upon his
      forehead, and glanced towards Eugene's boots that projected a considerable
      way beyond the line of the car. &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;The Macnamaras
      descend to ally themselves with any other family only for the sake of
      keeping up the race. It's their solemn duty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not go on any farther on such an errand&mdash;I will not be such a
      fool,&rdquo; said Standish, making a movement on his side of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said The Macnamara unconcernedly, &ldquo;my boy, you can get off at
      any moment; your presence will make no difference in the matter. The
      matrimonial alliances of The Macnamaras are family matters, not
      individual. The head of the race only is accountable to posterity for the
      consequences of the acts of them under him. I'm the head of the race.&rdquo; He
      removed his hat and looked upward, somewhat jerkily, but still
      impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standish Macnamara's eyes flashed and his hands clenched themselves over
      the rail of the car, but he did not make any attempt to carry out his
      threat of getting off. He did not utter another word. How could he? It was
      torture to him to hear his father discuss beneath the ear of the boy
      Eugene such a question as his confession of love for a certain lady. It
      was terrible for him to observe the expression of interest which was
      apparent upon the ingenuous face of Eugene, and to see his nods of
      approval at the words of The Macnamara. What could poor Standish do beyond
      closing his teeth very tightly and clenching his hands madly as the car
      jerked its way along the coast of Lough Suangorm, in view of a portion of
      the loveliest scenery in the world?

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE road upon which
      the car was driving was made round an elevated part of the coast of the
      lough. It curved away from where the castle of The Macnamaras was situated
      on one side of the water, to the termination of the lough. It did not
      slope downwards in the least at any part, but swept on to the opposite
      lofty shore, five hundred feet above the great rollers from the Atlantic
      that spent themselves amongst the half-hidden rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car jerked on in silence after The Macnamara had spoken his impressive
      sentence. Standish's hands soon relaxed their passionate hold upon the
      rail of the car, and, in spite of his consciousness of being twenty-three
      years of age, he found it almost impossible to restrain his tears of
      mortification from bursting their bonds. He knew how pure&mdash;how
      fervent&mdash;how exhaustless was the love that filled all his heart. He
      had been loving, not without hope, but without utterance, for years, and
      now all the fruit of his patience&mdash;of his years of speechlessness&mdash;would
      be blighted by the ridiculous action of his father. What would now be left
      for him in the world? he asked himself, and the despairing tears of his
      heart gave him his only answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on the seaward side of the car, which was now passing out of the
      green shade of the boughs that for three miles overhung the road. Then as
      the curve of the termination of the lough was approached, the full
      panorama of sea and coast leapt into view, with all the magical glamour
      those wizards Motion and Height can enweave round a scene. Far beneath,
      the narrow band of blue water lost itself amongst the steep cliffs. The
      double coasts of the lough that were joined at the point of vision,
      broadened out in undulating heights towards the mighty headlands of the
      entrance, that lifted up their hoary brows as the lion-waves of the
      Atlantic leapt between them and crouched in unwieldy bulk at their bases.
      Far away stretched that ocean, its horizon lost in mist; and above the
      line of rugged coast-cliff arose mountains&mdash;mighty masses tumbled
      together in black confusion, like Titanic gladiators locked in the close
      throes of the wrestle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had the familiar scene so taken Standish in its arms, so to
      speak, as it did now. He felt it. He looked down at the screen islands of
      the lough encircled with the floss of the moving waters; he looked along
      the slopes of the coasts with the ruins of ancient days on their summits,
      then his eyes went out to where the sun dipped towards the Atlantic, and
      he felt no more that passion of mortification which his reflections had
      aroused. Quickly as it had sprung into view the scene dissolved, as the
      car entered a glen, dim in the shadow of a great hill whose slope, swathed
      in purple heather to its highest peak, made a twilight at noon-day to all
      beneath. In the distance of the winding road beyond the dark edge of the
      mountain were seen the gray ridges of another range running far inland.
      With the twilight shadow of the glen, the shadow seemed to come again over
      the mind of Standish. He gave himself up to his own sad thoughts, and
      when, from a black tarn amongst the low pine-trees beneath the road, a
      tall heron rose and fled silently through the silent air to the foot of
      the slope, he regarded it ominously, as he would have done a raven.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they sat speechless upon the car. The Macnamara, who was a short,
      middle-aged man with a rather highly-coloured face, and features that not
      even the most malignant could pronounce of a Roman or even of a Saxon
      type, was sitting in silent dignity of which he seemed by no means
      unconscious Standish, who was tall, slender almost to a point of lankness,
      and gray-eyed, was morosely speechless, his father felt. Nature had not
      given The Macnamara a son after his own heart. The young man's features,
      that had at one time showed great promise of developing into the pure
      Milesian, had not fulfilled the early hope they had raised in his father's
      bosom; they had within the past twelve years exhibited a downward tendency
      that was not in keeping with the traditions of The Macnamaras. If the
      direction of the caressing hand of Nature over the features of the family
      should be reversed, what would remain to distinguish The Macnamaras from
      their Saxon invaders? This was a question whose weight had for some time
      oppressed the representative of the race; and he could only quiet his
      apprehension by the assurance which forced itself upon his mind, that
      Nature would never persist in any course prejudicial to her own interests
      in the maintenance of an irreproachable type of manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was a great grief to the father to become aware of the fact that
      the speech of Standish was all unlike his own in accent; it was, indeed,
      terribly like the ordinary Saxon speech&mdash;at least it sounded so to
      The Macnamara, whose vowels were diphthongic to a marked degree. But of
      course the most distressing reflection of the head of the race had
      reference to the mental disqualifications of his son to sustain the
      position which he would some day have to occupy as The Macnamara; for
      Standish had of late shown a tendency to accept the position accorded to
      him by the enemies of his race, and to allow that there existed a certain
      unwritten statute of limitations in the maintenance of the divine right of
      monarchs. He actually seemed to be under the impression that because nine
      hundred years had elapsed since a Macnamara had been the acknowledged king
      of Munster, the claim to be regarded as a royal family should not be
      strongly urged. This was very terrible to The Macnamara. And now he
      reflected upon all these matters as he held in a fixed and fervent grasp
      the somewhat untrustworthy rail of the undoubtedly shaky vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus in silence the car was driven through the dim glen, until the slope
      on the seaward-side of the road dwindled away and once more the sea came
      in sight; and, with the first glimpse of the sea, the square tower of an
      old, though not an ancient, castle that stood half hidden by trees at the
      base of the purple mountain. In a few minutes the car pulled up at the
      entrance gate to a walled demesne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will yer honours git off here?&rdquo; asked Eugene, preparing to throw the
      reins down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried The Macnamara emphatically. &ldquo;Never will the head of the
      race descend to walk up to the door of a foreigner. Drive up to the very
      hall, Eugene, as the great Brian Macnamara would have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' it's hopin' I am that his car-sphrings wouldn't be mindid with hemp,&rdquo;
       remarked the boy, as he pulled the horse round and urged his mild career
      through the great pillars at the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything about this place gave signs of having been cared for. The
      avenue was long, but it could be traversed without any risk of the vehicle
      being lost in the landslip of a rut. The grass around the trees, though by
      no means trimmed at the edges, was still not dank with weeds, and the
      trees themselves, if old, had none of the gauntness apparent in all the
      timber about the castle of The Macnamara. As the car went along there was
      visible every now and again the flash of branching antlers among the green
      foliage, and more than once the stately head of a red deer appeared gazing
      at the visitors, motionless, as if the animal had been a painted statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle, opposite whose black oak door Eugene at last dropped his
      reins, was by no means an imposing building. It was large and square, and
      at one wing stood the square ivy-covered tower that was seen from the
      road. Above it rose the great dark mountain ridge, and in front rolled the
      Atlantic, for the trees prevented the shoreway from being seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugene, knock at the door of the Geralds,&rdquo; said The Macnamara from his
      seat on the car, with a dignity the emphasis of which would have been
      diminished had he dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugene&mdash;looked upward at this order, shook his head in wonderment,
      and then got down, but not with quite the same expedition as his boot,
      which could not sustain the severe test of being suspended for any time in
      the air. He had not fully secured it again on his bare foot before a laugh
      sounded from the balcony over the porch&mdash;a laugh that made Standish's
      face redder than any rose&mdash;that made Eugene glance up with a grin and
      touch his hat, even before a girl's voice was heard saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Eugene, Eugene! What a clumsy fellow you are, to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don't be a sayin' of that, Miss Daireen, ma'am,&rdquo; the boy replied, as
      he gave a final stamp to secure possession of the boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Macnamara looked up and gravely removed his hat; but Standish having
      got down from the car turned his gaze seawards. Had he followed his
      father's example, he would have seen the laughing face and the graceful
      figure of a girl leaning over the balustrade of the porch surveying the
      group beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you do, Macnamara?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No, no, don't let Eugene knock;
      all the dogs are asleep except King Cormac, and I am too grateful to allow
      their rest to be broken. I'll go down and give you entrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared from the balcony, and in a few moments the hall door was
      softly sundered and the western sunlight fell about the form of the
      portress. The girl was tall and exquisitely moulded, from her little blue
      shoe to her rich brown hair, over which the sun made light and shade; her
      face was slightly flushed with her rapid descent and the quick kiss of the
      sunlight, and her eyes were of the most gracious gray that ever shone or
      laughed or wept. But her mouth&mdash;it was a visible song. It expressed
      all that song is capable of suggesting&mdash;passion of love or of anger,
      comfort of hope or of charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter, O my king-,&rdquo; she said, giving The Macnamara her hand; then turning
      to Standish, &ldquo;How do you do, Standish? Why do you not come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Standish uttered no word. He took her hand for a second and followed
      his father into the big square oaken hall. All were black oak, floor and
      wall and ceiling, only while the sunlight leapt through the open door was
      the sombre hue relieved by the flashing of the arms that lined the walls,
      and the glittering of the enormous elk-antlers that spread their branches
      over the lintels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you drove all round the coast to see me, I hope,&rdquo; said the girl, as
      they stood together under the battle-axes of the brave days of old, when
      the qualifications for becoming a successful knight and a successful
      blacksmith were identical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We drove round to admire the beauty of the lovely Daireen,&rdquo; said The
      Macnamara, with a flourish of the hand that did him infinite credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; laughed the girl, &ldquo;your visit will not be a long one.&rdquo;
       She was standing listlessly caressing with her hand the coarse hide of
      King Corrnac, a gigantic Wolf-dog, and in that posture looked like a
      statue of the Genius of her country. The dog had been welcoming Standish a
      moment before, and the young man's hand still resting upon its head, felt
      the casual touch of the girl's fingers as she played with the animal's
      ears. Every touch sent a thrill of passionate delight through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beauty of the daughter of the Geralds is worth coming so far to see;
      and now that I look at her before me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you know that it is impossible to make out a single feature in this
      darkness,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;So come along into the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with the lovely Daireen, my boy,&rdquo; said The Macnamara, as the girl led
      the way across the hall. &ldquo;For myself, I think I'll just turn in here.&rdquo; He
      opened a door at one side of the hall and exposed to view, within the room
      beyond, a piece of ancient furniture which was not yet too decrepit to
      sustain the burden of a row of square glass bottles and tumblers. But
      before he entered he whispered to Standish with an appropriate action,
      &ldquo;Make it all right with her by the time come I back.&rdquo; And so he vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Macnamara is right,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;You must join him in taking a
      glass of wine after your long drive, Standish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since he had spoken on the car Standish found his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want to drink anything, Daireen,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall go round to the garden and try to find grandpapa, if you
      don't want to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her brown unbonneted hair tossing in its irregular strands about her
      neck, she went out by a door at the farther end of the square hall, and
      Standish followed her by a high-arched passage that seemed to lead right
      through the building. At the extremity was an iron gate which the girl
      unlocked, and they passed into a large garden somewhat wild in its growth,
      but with its few brilliant spots of colour well brought out by the general
      <i>feeling</i> of purple that forced itself upon every one beneath the
      shadow of the great mountain-peak. Very lovely did that world of heather
      seem now as the sun burned over against the slope, stirring up the
      wonderful secret hues of dark blue and crimson. The peak stood out in bold
      relief against the pale sky, and above its highest point an eagle sailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have such good news for you, Standish,&rdquo; said Miss Gerald. &ldquo;You cannot
      guess what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot guess what good news there could possibly be in store for me,&rdquo;
       he replied, with so much sadness in his voice that the girl gave a little
      start, and then the least possible smile, for she was well aware that the
      luxury of sadness was frequently indulged in by her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good news for you, for me, for all of us, for all the world, for&mdash;well,
      for everybody that I have not included. Don't laugh at me, please, for my
      news is that papa is coming home at last. Now, isn't that good news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Standish. &ldquo;I am very glad because I know
      it will make you happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nicely said; and I know you feel it, my dear Standish. Ah, poor papa!
      he has had a hard time of it, battling with the terrible Indian climate
      and with those annoying people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a life worth living,&rdquo; cried Standish. &ldquo;After you are dead the world
      feels that you have lived in it. The world is the better for your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;Papa leaves India crowned with honours, as
      the newspapers say. The Queen has made him a C.B., you know. But&mdash;only
      think how provoking it is&mdash;he has been ordered by the surgeon of his
      regiment to return by long-sea, instead of overland, for the sake of his
      health; so that though I got his letter from Madras yesterday to tell me
      that he was at the point of starting, it will be another month before I
      can see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then he will no doubt have completely recovered,&rdquo; said Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my only consolation. Yes; he will be himself again&mdash;himself
      as I saw him five years ago in our bungalow&mdash;how well I remember it
      and its single plantain-tree in the garden where the officers used to hunt
      me for kisses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standish frowned. It was, to him, a hideous recollection for the girl to
      have. He would cheerfully have undertaken the strangulation of each of
      those sportive officers. &ldquo;I should have learned a great deal during these
      five years that have passed since I was sent to England to school, but I'm
      afraid I didn't. Never mind, papa won't cross-examine me to see if his
      money has been wasted. But why do you look so sad, Standish? You do look
      sad, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel it too,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I feel more wretched than I can tell you. I'm
      sick of everything here&mdash;no, not here, you know, but at home. There I
      am in that cursed jail, shut out from the world, a beggar without the
      liberty to beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Standish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is the truth, Daireen. I might as well be dead as living as I am.
      Yes, better&mdash;I wish to God I was dead, for then there might be at
      least some chance of making a beginning in a new sort of life under
      different conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it wicked to talk that way, Standish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he replied doggedly. &ldquo;Wickedness and goodness have ceased
      to be anything more to me than vague conditions of life in a world I have
      nothing to say to. I cannot be either good or bad here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen looked very solemn at this confession of impotence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me you meant to speak to The Mac-namara about going away or
      doing something,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I did speak to him, but it came to the one end: it was a disgrace for
      the son of the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; bah, you know how he talks. Every
      person of any position laughs at him; only those worse than himself think
      that he is wronged. But I'll do something, if it should only be to enlist
      as a common soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Standish, do not talk that way, like a good boy,&rdquo; she said, laying her
      hand upon his arm. &ldquo;I have a bright thought for the first time: wait just
      for another month until papa is here, and he will, you may be sure, tell
      you what is exactly right to do. Oh, there is grandpapa, with his gun as
      usual, coming from the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They saw at a little distance the figure of a tall old man carrying a gun,
      and followed by a couple of sporting dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen,&rdquo; said Standish, stopping suddenly as if a thought had just
      struck him. &ldquo;Daireen, promise me that you will not let anything my father
      may say here to-day make you think badly of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious! why should I ever do that? What is he going to say that is
      so dreadful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you, Daireen; but you will promise me;&rdquo; he had seized her
      by the hand and was looking with earnest entreaty into her eyes.
      &ldquo;Daireen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you will give me your word. You have been such a
      friend to me always&mdash;such a good angel to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we shall always be friends, Standish. I promise you this. Now let go
      my hand, like a good boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed her, and in a few minutes they had met Daireen's grandfather,
      Mr. Gerald, who had been coming towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, The Macnamara here? then I must hasten to him,&rdquo; said the old
      gentleman, handing his gun to Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knew better than Mr. Gerald the necessity that existed for
      hastening to The Macnamara, in case of his waiting for a length of time in
      that room the sideboard of which was laden with bottles.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Macnamara had
      been led away from his companionship in that old oak room by the time his
      son and Miss Gerald returned from the garden, and the consciousness of his
      own dignity seemed to have increased considerably since they had left him.
      This emotion was a variable possession with him: any one acquainted with
      his habits could without difficulty, from knowing the degree of dignity he
      manifested at any moment, calculate minutely the space of time, he must of
      necessity have spent in a room furnished similarly to that he had just now
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking pretty loudly in the room to which he had been led by Mr.
      Gerald when Daireen and Standish entered; and beside him was a whitehaired
      old lady whom Standish greeted as Mrs. Gerald and the girl called
      grandmamma&mdash;an old lady with very white hair but with large dark eyes
      whose lustre remained yet undimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Standish will reveal the mystery,&rdquo; said this old lady, as the young man
      shook hands with her. &ldquo;Your father has been speaking in proverbs,
      Standish, and we want your assistance to read them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my son,&rdquo; said The Macnamara, waving his hand proudly and lifting up
      his head. &ldquo;He will hear his father speak on his behalf. Head of the
      Geralds, Gerald-na-Tor, chief of the hills, the last of The Macnamaras,
      king's of Munster, Innishdermot, and all islands, comes to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am honoured by his visit, and glad to find him looking so well.&rdquo;
       said Mr. Gerald. &ldquo;I am only sorry you can't make it suit you to come
      oftener, Macnamara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that boy Eugene that's at fault,&rdquo; said The Macnamara, dropping so
      suddenly into a colloquial speech from his eloquent Ossianic strain that
      one might have been led to believe his opening words were somewhat forced.
      &ldquo;Yes, my lad,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Mr. Gerald; &ldquo;that Eugene is either
      breaking the springs or the straps or his own bones.&rdquo; Here he recollected
      that his mission was not one to be expressed in this ordinary vein. He
      straightened himself in an instant, and as he went on asserted even more
      dignity than before. &ldquo;Gerald, you know my position, don't you? and you
      know your 'own; but you can't say, can you, that The Macnamara ever held
      himself aloof from your table by any show of pride? I mixed with you as if
      we were equals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he waved his hand patronisingly, but no one showed the least sign of
      laughter. Standish was in front of one of the windows leaning his head
      upon his hand as he looked out to the misty ocean. &ldquo;Yes, I've treated you
      at all times as if you had been born of the land, though this ground we
      tread on this moment was torn from the grasp of The Macnamaras by fraud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true&mdash;six hundred years ago,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gerald. He had been
      so frequently reminded of this fact during his acquaintance with The
      Macnamara, he could afford to make the concession he now did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've not let that rankle in my heart,&rdquo; continued The Macnamara; &ldquo;I've
      descended to break bread with you and to drink&mdash;drink water with you&mdash;ay,
      at times. You know my son too, and you know that if he's not the same as
      his father to the backbone, it's not his father that's to blame for it. It
      was the last wish of his poor mother&mdash;rest her soul!&mdash;that he
      should be schooled outside our country, and you know that I carried out
      her will, though it cost me dear. He's been back these four years, as you
      know&mdash;what's he looking out at at the window?&mdash;but it's only
      three since he found out the pearl of the Lough Suangorm&mdash;the diamond
      of Slieve Docas&mdash;the beautiful daughter of the Geralds. Ay, he
      confessed to me this morning where his soft heart had turned, poor boy.
      Don't be blushing, Standish; the blood of the Macnamaras shouldn't betray
      itself in their cheeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standish had started away from the window before his father had ended; his
      hands were clenched, and his cheeks were burning with shame. He could not
      fail to see the frown that was settling down upon the face of Mr. Gerald.
      But he dared not even glance towards Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Macnamara, we needn't talk on this subject any farther just now,&rdquo;
       said the girl's grandfather, as the orator paused for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But The Macnamara only gave his hand another wave before he proceeded. &ldquo;I
      have promised my boy to make him happy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you know what the
      word of a Macnamara is worth even to his son; so, though I confess I was
      taken aback at first, yet I at last consented to throw over my natural
      family pride and to let my boy have his way. An alliance between the
      Macnamaras and the Geralds is not what would have been thought about a few
      years ago, but The Macnamaras have always been condescending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you condescend to a jest now and again with us, but really this
      is a sort of mystery I have no clue to,&rdquo; said Mr. Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mystery? Ay, it will astonish the world to know that The Macnamara has
      given his consent to such an alliance; it must be kept secret for a while
      for fear of its effects upon the foreign States that have their eyes upon
      all our steps. I wouldn't like this made a State affair at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Macnamara, you are usually very lucid,&rdquo; said Mr. Gerald, &ldquo;but
      to-day I somehow cannot arrive at your meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir?&rdquo; cried The Macnamara, giving his head an angry twitch. &ldquo;What,
      sir, do you mean to tell me that you don't understand that I have given my
      consent to my son taking as his wife the daughter of the Geralds?&mdash;see
      how the lovely Daireen blushes like a rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen was certainly blushing, as she left her seat and went over to the
      farthest end of the room. But Standish was deadly pale, his lips tightly
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Macnamara, this is absurd&mdash;quite absurd!&rdquo; said Mr. Gerald, hastily
      rising. &ldquo;Pray let us talk no more in such a strain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then The Macnamara's consciousness of his own dignity asserted itself. He
      drew himself up and threw back his head. &ldquo;Sir, do you mean to put an
      affront upon the one who has left his proper station to raise your family
      to his own level?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let us quarrel, Macnamara; you know how highly I esteem you
      personally, and you know that I have ever looked upon the family of the
      Macnamaras as the noblest in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is the noblest in the land. There's not a drop of blood in our
      veins that hasn't sprung from the heart of a king,&rdquo; cried The Macnamara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know it; but&mdash;well, we will not talk any further to-day.
      Daireen, you needn't go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! do you mean to say that I haven't spoken plainly enough, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Macnamara, I must really interrupt you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; cried the representative of the ancient line, his face
      developing all the secret resources of redness it possessed. &ldquo;Must you
      interrupt the hereditary monarch of the country where you're but an
      immigrant when he descends to equalise himself with you? This is the
      reward of condescension! Enough, sir, you have affronted the family that
      were living in castles when your forefathers were like beasts in caves.
      The offer of an alliance ought to have come from you, not from me; but
      never again will it be said that The Macnamara forgot what was due to him
      and his family. No, by the powers, Gerald, you'll never have the chance
      again. I scorn you; I reject your alliance. The Macnamara seats himself
      once more upon his ancient throne, and he tramples upon you all. Come, my
      son, look at him that has insulted your family&mdash;look at him for the
      last time and lift up your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grandeur with which The Macnamara uttered this speech was
      overpowering. He had at its conclusion turned towards poor Standish, and
      waved his hand in the direction of Mr. Gerald. Then Standish seemed to
      have recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father, it is you who have insulted this family by talking as you
      have done,&rdquo; he cried passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; shouted The Macnamara. &ldquo;Recreant son of a noble race, don't demean
      yourself with such language!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you who have demeaned our family,&rdquo; cried the son still more
      energetically. &ldquo;You have sunk us even lower than we were before.&rdquo; Then he
      turned imploringly towards Mr. Gerald. &ldquo;You know&mdash;you know that I am
      only to be pitied, not blamed, for my father's words,&rdquo; he said quietly,
      and then went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said the old lady, hastening towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; cried The Macnamara, raising his arm majestically to stay her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped in the centre of the room. Daireen had also risen, her pure
      eyes full of tears as she grasped her grandfather's hand while he laid his
      other upon her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the door Standish looked with passionate gratitude back to the girl,
      then rushed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But The Macnamara stood for some moments with his head elevated, the
      better to express the scorn that was in his heart. No one made a motion,
      and then he stalked after his son.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O do The Macnamara
      justice, while he was driving homeward upon that very shaky car round the
      lovely coast, he was somewhat disturbed in mind as he reflected upon the
      possible consequences of his quarrel with old Mr. Gerald. He was dimly
      conscious of the truth of the worldly and undeniably selfish maxim
      referring to the awkwardness of a quarrel with a neighbour. And if there
      is any truth in it as a general maxim, its value is certainly intensified
      when the neighbour in question has been the lender of sundry sums of
      money. A neighbour under these conditions should not be quarrelled with,
      he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Macnamara had borrowed from Mr. Gerald, at various times, certain
      moneys which had amounted in the aggregate to a considerable sum; for
      though Daireen's grandfather was not possessed of a very large income from
      the land that had been granted to his ancestors some few hundred years
      before, he had still enough to enable him from time to time to oblige The
      Macnamara with a loan. And this reflection caused The Macnamara about as
      much mental uneasiness as the irregular motion of the vehicle did physical
      discomfort. By the time, however, that the great hill, whose heather slope
      was now wrapped in the purple shade of twilight, its highest peak alone
      being bathed in the red glory of the sunset, was passed, his mind was
      almost at ease; for he recalled the fact that his misunderstandings with
      Mr. Gerald were exactly equal in number to his visits; he never passed an
      hour at Suanmara without what would at any rate have been a quarrel but
      for Mr. Gerald's good nature, which refused to be ruffled. And as no
      reference had ever upon these occasions been made to his borrowings, The
      Macnamara felt that he had no reason to conclude that his present quarrel
      would become embarrassing through any action of Mr. Gerald's. So he tried
      to feel the luxury of the scorn that he had so powerfully expressed in the
      room at Suanmara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mushrooms of a night's growth!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I trampled them beneath my
      feet. They may go down on their knees before me now, I'll have nothing to
      say to them.&rdquo; Then as the car passed out of the glen and he saw before him
      the long shadows of the hills lying amongst the crimson and yellow flames
      that swept from the sunset out on the Atlantic, and streamed between the
      headlands at the entrance to the lough, he became more fixed in his
      resolution. &ldquo;The son of The Macnamara will never wed with the daughter of
      a man that is paid by the oppressors of the country, no, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an allusion to the fact of Daireen's father being a colonel in
      the British army, on service in India. Then exactly between the headlands
      the sun went down in a gorgeous mist that was permeated with the glow of
      the orb it enveloped. The waters shook and trembled in the light, but the
      many islands of the lough remained dark and silent in the midst of the
      glow. The Macnamara became more resolute still. He had almost forgotten
      that he had ever borrowed a penny from Mr. Gerald. He turned to where
      Standish sat silent and almost grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, boy,&rdquo; said the father&mdash;&ldquo;you, that threw your insults in my
      face&mdash;you, that's a disgrace to the family&mdash;I've made up my mind
      what I'll do with you; I'll&mdash;yes, by the powers, I'll disinherit
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But not a word did Standish utter in reply to this threat, the force of
      which, coupled with an expressive motion of the speaker, jeopardised the
      imperfect spring, and wrung from Eugene a sudden exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy mother o' Saint Malachi, kape the sthring from breakin' yit awhile!&rdquo;
       he cried devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed that the driver's devotion was efficacious, for, without any
      accident, the car reached the entrance to Innishdermot, as the residence
      of the ancient monarchs had been called since the days when the waters of
      Lough Suangorm had flowed all about the castle slope, for even the lough
      had become reduced in strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twilight, rich and blue, was now swathing the mountains and
      overshadowing the distant cliffs, though the waters at their base were
      steel gray and full of light that seemed to shine upwards through their
      depth. Desolate, truly, the ruins loomed through the dimness. Only a
      single feeble light glimmered from one of the panes, and even this seemed
      agonising to the owls, for they moaned wildly and continuously from the
      round tower. There was, indeed, scarcely an aspect of welcome in anything
      that surrounded this home which one family had occupied for seven hundred
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the car stopped at the door, however, there came a voice from an unseen
      figure, saying, in even a more pronounced accent than The Macnamara
      himself gloried in, &ldquo;Wilcome, ye noble sonns of noble soyers! Wilcome back
      to the anshent home of the gloryous race that'll stand whoile there's a
      sod of the land to bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's The Randal himself,&rdquo; said The Macnamara, looking in the direction
      from which the sound came. &ldquo;And where is it that you are, Randal? Oh, I
      see your pipe shining like a star out of the ivy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the forest of ivy that clung about the porch of the castle the figure
      of a small man emerged. One of his hands was in his pocket, the other
      removed a short black pipe, the length of whose stem in comparison to the
      breadth of its bowl was as the proportion of Falstaff's bread to his sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilcome back, Macnamara,&rdquo; said this gentleman, who was indeed The Randal,
      hereditary chief of Suangorm. &ldquo;An' Standish too, how are ye, my boy?&rdquo;
       Standish shook hands with the speaker, but did not utter a word. &ldquo;An'
      where is it ye're afther dhrivin' from?&rdquo; continued The Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a long drive and a long story,&rdquo; said The Macnamara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin for hivin's sake don't begin it till we've put boy the dinner. I'm
      goin' to take share with ye this day, and I'm afther waitin' an hour and
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's welcome The Randal is every day in the week,&rdquo; said The Macnamara,
      leading the way into the great dilapidated hall, where in the ancient days
      fifty men-at-arms had been wont to feast royally. Now it was black in
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the room where the dinner was laid there were but two candles, and
      their feeble glimmer availed no more than to make the blotches on the
      cloth more apparent: the maps of the British Isles done in mustard and
      gravy were numerous. At each end a huge black bottle stood like a sentry
      at the border of a snowfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      By far the greater portion of the light was supplied by the blazing log in
      the fireplace. It lay not in any grate but upon the bare hearth, and
      crackled and roared up the chimney like a demon prostrate in torture. The
      Randal and his host stood before the blaze, while Standish seated himself
      in another part of the room. The ruddy flicker of the wood fire shone upon
      the faces of the two men, and the yellow glimmer of the candle upon the
      face of Standish. Here and there a polish upon the surface of the black
      oak panelling gleamed, but all the rest of the high room was dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salmon from the lough, venison from the forest, wild birds from the moor
      made up the dinner. All were served on silver dishes strangely worked, and
      plates of the same metal were laid before the diners, while horns mounted
      on massive stands were the drinking vessels. From these dishes The
      Macnamaras of the past had eaten, and from these horns they had drunken,
      and though the present head of the family could have gained many years'
      income had he given the metal to be melted, he had never for an instant
      thought of taking such a step. He would have starved with that plate empty
      in front of him sooner than have sold it to buy bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standish spoke no word during the entire meal, and the guest saw that
      something had gone wrong; so with his native tact he chatted away, asking
      questions, but waiting for no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the table was cleared and the old serving-woman had brought in a
      broken black kettle of boiling water, and had laid in the centre of the
      table an immense silver bowl for the brewing of the punch, The Randal drew
      up the remnant of his collar and said: &ldquo;Now for the sthory of the droive,
      Macnamara; I'm riddy whin ye fill the bowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standish rose from the table and walked away to a seat at the furthest end
      of the great room, where he sat hidden in the gloom of the corner. The
      Randal did not think it inconsistent with his chieftainship to wink at his
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Randal,&rdquo; said The Macnamara, &ldquo;I've made up my mind. I'll disinherit that
      boy, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried The Randal eagerly. &ldquo;Don't spake so loud, man; if this should
      git wind through the counthry who knows what might happen? Disinhirit the
      boy; ye don't mane it, Macnamara,&rdquo; he continued in an excited but
      awe-stricken whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But by the powers, I do mean it,&rdquo; cried The Macnamara, who had been
      testing the potent elements of the punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disinherit me, will you, father?&rdquo; came the sudden voice of Standish
      echoing strangely down the dark room. Then he rose and stood facing both
      men at the table, the red glare of the log mixing with the sickly
      candlelight upon his face and quivering hands. &ldquo;Disinherit me?&rdquo; he said
      again, bitterly. &ldquo;You cannot do that. I wish you could. My inheritance,
      what is it? Degradation of family, proud beggary, a life to be wasted
      outside the world of life and work, and a death rejoiced over by those
      wretches who have lent you money. Disinherit me from all this, if you
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Saint Malachi, hare the sonn of The Macnamaras talkin' loike a
      choild!&rdquo; cried The Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care who hears me,&rdquo; said Standish. &ldquo;I'm sick of hearing about my
      forefathers; no one cares about them nowadays. I wanted years ago to go
      out into the world and work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work&mdash;a Macnamara work!&rdquo; cried The Randal horror-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said The Macnamara, in the tone of one who finds sudden
      confirmation to the improbable story of some enormity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to work as a man should to redeem the shame which our life as it
      is at present brings upon our family,&rdquo; said the young man earnestly&mdash;almost
      passionately; &ldquo;but I was not allowed to do anything that I wanted. I was
      kept here in this jail wasting my best years; but to-day has brought
      everything to an end. You say you will disinherit me, father, but I have
      from this day disinherited myself&mdash;I have cast off my old existence.
      I begin life from to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned away and went out of the room, leaving his father and his
      guest in dumb amazement before their punch. It was some minutes before
      either could speak. At last The Randal took adraught of the hot spirit,
      and shook his head thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! poor boy! he needs to be looked after till he gets over this
      turn,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all that girl&mdash;that Daireen of the Geralds,&rdquo; said The
      Macnamara. &ldquo;I found a paper with poetry on it for her this morning, and
      when I forced him he confessed that he was in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'ye tell me that? And what more did ye do, Mac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; said the hereditary prince, leaning over the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he gave his guest all the details of the visit to the Geralds at
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      But poor Standish had rushed up the crumbling staircase and was lying on
      his bed with his face in his hands. It was only now he seemed to feel all
      the shame that had caused his face to be red and pale by turns in the
      drawing-room at Suanmara. He lay there in a passion of tears, while the
      great owls kept moaning and hooting in the tower just outside his window,
      making sympathetic melody to his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he arose and went over to the window and stood gazing out through
      the break in the ivy armour of the wall. He gazed over the tops of the
      trees growing in a straggling way down the slope to the water's edge. He
      could see far away the ocean, whose voice he now and again heard as the
      wind bore it around the tower. Thousands of stars glittered above the
      water and trembled upon its moving surface. He felt strong now. He felt
      that he might never weep again in the world as he had just wept. Then he
      turned to another window and sent his eyes out to where that great peak of
      Slieve Docas stood out dark and terrible among the stars. He could not see
      the house at the base of the hill, but he clenched his hands as he looked
      out, saying &ldquo;Hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was late before he got into his bed, and it was still later when he
      awoke and heard, mingling with the cries of the night-birds, the sound of
      hoarse singing that floated upward from the room where he had left his
      father and The Randal. The prince and the chief were joining their voices
      in a native melody, Standish knew; and he was well aware that he would not
      be disturbed by the ascent of either during the night. The dormitory
      arrangements of the prince and the chief when they had dined in company
      were of the simplest nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standish went to sleep again, and the ancient rafters, that had heard the
      tones of many generations of Macnamaras' voices, trembled for some hours
      with the echoes from the room below, while outside the ancient owls hooted
      and the ancient sea murmured in its sleep.

      harp-music were ascending at even from the depths of Glenmara. The sun had
      sunk, and the hues that had been woven round the west were wasting
      themselves away on the horizon. The faint shell-pink had drifted and
      dwindled far from the place of sunset. The woods of the slopes looked very
      dark now that the red glances from the west were withdrawn from their
      glossy foliage; but the heather-swathed mountains, towering through the
      soft blue air to the dark blue sky, were richly purple, as though the
      sunset hues had become entangled amongst the heather, and had forgotten to
      fly back to the west that had cast them forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little tarn at the foot of the lowest crags was black and still,
      waiting for the first star-glimpse, and from its marge came the wild notes
      of a harp fitfully swelling and waning; and then arose the still wilder
      and more melancholy tones of a man's voice chanting what seemed like a
      weird dirge to the fading twilight, and the language was the Irish Celtic&mdash;that
      language every song of which sounds like a dirge sung over its own death:&mdash;

    <p>
      This is a translation of the wild lament that arose in the twilight air
      and stirred up the echoes of the rocks. Then the fitful melody of the harp
      made an interlude:&mdash;

      Again the chaunter paused and again his harp prolonged the wailing melody.
      Then passing into a more sadly soft strain, he continued his song:&mdash;

    <p>
      Into the twilight the last notes died away, and a lonely heron standing
      among the rushes at the edge of the tarn moved his head critically to one
      side as if waiting for another song with which to sympathise. But he was
      not the only listener. Far up among the purple crags Standish Macnamara
      was lying looking out to the sunset when he heard the sound of the chant
      in the glen beneath him. He lay silent while the dirge floated up the
      mountain-side and died away among the heather of the peak. But when the
      silence of the twilight came once more upon the glen, Standish arose and
      made his way downwards to where an old man with one of the small ancient
      Irish harps, was seated on a stone, his head bent across the strings upon
      which his fingers still rested. Standish knew him to be one Murrough
      O'Brian, a descendant of the bards of the country, and an old retainer of
      the Gerald family. A man learned in Irish, but not speaking an
      intelligible sentence in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you sing the Dirge of Tuathal on this evening, Murrough?&rdquo; he asked
      in his native tongue, as he came beside the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else is there left for me to sing at this time, Standish O'Dermot
      Macnamara, son of the Prince of Islands and all Munster?&rdquo; said the bard.
      &ldquo;There is nothing of joy left us now. We cannot sing except in sorrow.
      Does not the land seem to have sympathy with such songs, prolonging their
      sound by its own voice from every glen and mountain-face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Standish. &ldquo;As I sat up among the cliffs of heather it
      seemed to me that the melody was made by the spirits of the glen bewailing
      in the twilight the departure of the glory of our land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how desolate is all around us here,&rdquo; said the bard. &ldquo;Glenmara is
      lonely now, where it was wont to be gay with song and laughter; when the
      nobles thronged the valley with hawk and hound, the voice of the bugle and
      the melody of a hundred harps were heard stirring up the echoes in
      delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now all are gone; they can only be recalled in vain dreams,&rdquo; said the
      second in this duet of Celtic mourners&mdash;the younger Marius among the
      ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sons of Erin have left her in her loneliness while the world is
      stirred with their brave actions,&rdquo; continued the ancient bard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; cried Standish; &ldquo;outside is the world that needs Irish hands and
      hearts to make it better worth living in.&rdquo; The young man was so
      enthusiastic in the utterance of his part in the dialogue as to cause the
      bard to look suddenly up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the hands and the hearts of the Irish have done much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let
      the men go out into the world for a while, but let our daughters be spared
      to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standish gave a little start and looked inquiringly into the face of the
      bard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Murrough?&rdquo; he asked slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bard leant forward as if straining to catch some distant sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to it, listen to it,&rdquo; he said. There was a pause, and through the
      silence the moan of the far-off ocean was borne along the dim glen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the sound of the Atlantic,&rdquo; said Standish. &ldquo;The breeze from the
      west carries it to us up from the lough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to it and think that she is out on that far ocean,&rdquo; said the old
      man. &ldquo;Listen to it, and think that Daireen, daughter of the Geralds, has
      left her Irish home and is now tossing upon that ocean; gone is she, the
      bright bird of the South&mdash;gone from those her smile lightened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standish neither started nor uttered a word when the old man had spoken;
      but he felt his feet give way under him. He sat down upon a crag and laid
      his head upon his hand staring into the black tarn. He could not
      comprehend at first the force of the words &ldquo;She is gone.&rdquo; He had thought
      of his own departure, but the possibility of Daireen's had not occurred to
      him. The meaning of the bard's lament was now apparent to him, and even
      now the melody seemed to be given back by the rocks that had heard it:
    </p>
    <p>
      Why art thou gone from us, Soul of all beauty and joy?
    </p>
    <p>
      The words moaned through the dim air with the sound of the distant waters
      for accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone&mdash;gone&mdash;Daireen,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;And you only tell me of it
      now,&rdquo; he added almost fiercely to the old man, for he reflected upon the
      time he had wasted in that duet of lamentation over the ruins of his
      country. What a wretchedly trivial thing he felt was the condition of the
      country compared with such an event as the departure of Daireen Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only since morning that she is gone,&rdquo; said the bard. &ldquo;It was only
      in the morning that the letter arrived to tell her that her father was
      lying in a fever at some place where the vessel called on the way home.
      And now she is gone from us, perhaps for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murrough,&rdquo; said the young man, laying his hand upon the other's arm, and
      speaking in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Tell me all about her. Why did they allow
      her to go? Where is she gone? Not out to where her father was landed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not there?&rdquo; cried the old man, raising his head proudly. &ldquo;Did a
      Gerald ever shrink from duty when the hour came? Brave girl she is, worthy
      to be a Gerald!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all&mdash;all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more is there to tell than what is bound up in those three words
      'She is gone'?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;The letter came to her grandfather and she
      saw him read it&mdash;I was in the hall&mdash;she saw his hand tremble.
      She stood up there beside him and asked him what was in the letter; he
      looked into her face and put the letter in her hand. I saw her face grow
      pale as she read it. Then she sat down for a minute, but no word or cry
      came from her until she looked up to the old man's face; then she clasped
      her hands and said only, 'I will go to him.' The old people talked to her
      of the distance, of the danger; they told her how she would be alone for
      days and nights among strangers; but she only repeated, 'I will go to
      him.' And now she is gone&mdash;gone alone over those waters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone!&rdquo; Standish repeated. &ldquo;Gone away alone, no friend near her, none to
      utter a word of comfort in her ears!&rdquo; He buried his face in his hands as
      he pictured the girl whom he had loved silently, but with all his soul,
      since she had come to her home in Ireland from India where she had lived
      with her father since the death of his wife ten years ago. He pictured her
      sitting in her loneliness aboard the ship that was bearing her away to,
      perhaps, the land of her father's grave, and he felt that now at last all
      the bitterness that could be crowded upon his life had fallen on him. He
      gazed into the black tarn, and saw within its depths a star glittering as
      it glittered in the sky above, but it did not relieve his thoughts with
      any touch of its gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose after a while and gave his hand to Murrough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have told me all better than any one else could
      have done. But did she not speak of me, Murrough&mdash;only once perhaps?
      Did she not send me one little word of farewell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave me this for you,&rdquo; said the old bard, producing a letter which
      Standish clutched almost wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, thank God!&rdquo; he cried, hurrying away without another word. But
      after him swept the sound of the bard's lament which he commenced anew,
      with that query:
    </p>
    <p>
      Why art thou gone from us, Soul of all beauty and joy?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet too dark outside the glen for Standish to read the letter
      which he had just received; and so soon as he found himself in sight of
      the sea he tore open the cover and read the few lines Daireen Gerald had
      written, with a tremulous hand, to say farewell to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has been left ill with fever at the Cape, and I know that he
      will recover only if I go to him. I am going away to-day, for the steamer
      will leave Southampton in four days, and I cannot be there in time unless
      I start at once. I thought you would not like me to go without saying
      good-bye, and God bless you, dear Standish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will say good-bye to The Macnamara for me. I thought poor papa would
      be here to give you the advice you want. Pray to God that I may be in time
      to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read the lines by the gray light reflected from the sea&mdash;he read
      them until his eyes were dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave, glorious girl!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But to think of her&mdash;alone&mdash;alone
      out there, while I&mdash;&mdash; oh, what a poor weak fool I am! Here am I&mdash;here,
      looking out to the sea she is gone to battle with! Oh, God! oh, God! I
      must do something for her&mdash;I must&mdash;but what&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cast himself down upon the heather that crawled from the slopes even to
      the road, and there he lay with his head buried in agony at the thought of
      his own impotence; while through the dark glen floated the wild, weird
      strain of the lament:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why art thou gone from us, Soul of all beauty and joy?&rdquo;

      and the heather-clad mountains, from the blue loughs and their islands of
      arbutus, from the harp-music, and from the ocean-music which makes those
      who hear it ripe for revolt; away from the land whose life is the memory
      of ancient deeds of nobleness; away from the land that has given birth to
      more heroes than any nation in the world, the land whose inhabitants live
      in thousands in squalor and look out from mud windows upon the most
      glorious scenery in the world; away from all these one must now be borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the evening of the fourth day after the chanting of that lament by
      the bard O'Brian from the depths of Glenmara, the good steamship <i>Cardwell
      Castle</i> was making its way down Channel with a full cargo and heavy
      mails for Madeira, St. Helena, and the Cape. It had left its port but a
      few hours and already the coast had become dim with distance. The red
      shoreway of the south-west was now so far away that the level rays of
      sunlight which swept across the water were not seen to shine upon the
      faces of the rocks, or to show where the green fields joined the brown
      moorland; the windmills crowning every height were not seen to be in
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers were for the most part very cheerful, as passengers
      generally are during the first couple of hours of a voyage, when only the
      gentle ripples of the Channel lap the sides of the vessel. The old
      voyagers, who had thought it prudent to dine off a piece of sea-biscuit
      and a glass of brandy and water, while they watched with grim smiles the
      novices trifling with roast pork and apricot-dumplings, were now sitting
      in seats they had arranged for themselves in such places as they knew
      would be well to leeward for the greater part of the voyage, and here they
      smoked their cigars and read their newspapers just as they would be doing
      every day for three weeks. To them the phenomenon of the lessening land
      was not particularly interesting. The novices were endeavouring to look as
      if they had been used to knock about the sea all their lives; they carried
      their telescopes under their arms quite jauntily, and gave critical
      glances aloft every now and again, consulting their pocket compasses
      gravely at regular intervals to convince themselves that they were not
      being trifled with in the navigation of the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were, of course, those who had come aboard with the
      determination of learning in three weeks as much seamanship as should
      enable them to accept any post of marine responsibility that they might be
      called upon to fill in after life. They handled the loose tackle with a
      view of determining its exact utility, and endeavoured to trace stray
      lines to their source. They placed the captain entirely at his ease with
      them by asking him a number of questions regarding the dangers of
      boiler-bursting, and the perils of storms; they begged that he would let
      them know if there was any truth in the report which had reached them to
      the effect that the Atlantic was a very stormy place; and they left him
      with the entreaty that in case of any danger arising suddenly he would at
      once communicate with them; they then went down to put a few casual
      questions to the quartermaster who was at the wheel, and doubtless felt
      that they were making most of the people about them cheerful with their
      converse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were the young ladies who had just completed their education in
      England and were now on their way to join their relations abroad. Having
      read in the course of their studies of English literature the poems of the
      late Samuel Rogers, they were much amazed to find that the mariners were
      not leaning over the ship's bulwarks sighing to behold the sinking of
      their native land, and that not an individual had climbed the mast to
      partake of the ocular banquet with indulging in which the poet has
      accredited the sailor. Towards this section the glances of several male
      eyes were turned, for most of the young men had roved sufficiently far to
      become aware of the fact that the relief of the monotony of a lengthened
      voyage is principally dependent on&mdash;well, on the relieving capacities
      of the young ladies, lately sundered from school and just commencing their
      education in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But far away from the groups that hung about the stern stood a girl
      looking over the side of the ship towards the west&mdash;towards the sun
      that was almost touching the horizon. She heard the laughter of the groups
      of girls and the silly questions of the uninformed, but all sounded to her
      like the strange voices of a dream; for as she gazed towards the west she
      seemed to see a fair landscape of purple slopes and green woods; the dash
      of the ripples against the ship's side came to her as the rustle of the
      breaking ripples amongst the shells of a blue lough upon whose surface a
      number of green islets raised their heads. She saw them all&mdash;every
      islet, with its moveless I shadow beneath it, and the light touching the
      edges of the leaves with red. Daireen Gerald it was who stood there
      looking out to the sunset, but seeing in the golden lands of the west the
      Irish land she knew so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained motionless, with her eyes far away and her heart still
      farther, until the red sun had disappeared, and the delicate twilight
      change was slipping over the bright gray water. With every change she
      seemed to see the shifting of the hues over the heather of Slieve Docas
      and the pulsating of the tremulous red light through the foliage of the
      deer ground. It was only now that the tears forced themselves into her
      eyes, for she had not wept at parting from her grandfather, who had gone
      with her from Ireland and had left her aboard the steamer a few hours
      before; and while her tears made everything misty to her, the light
      laughter of the groups scattered about the quarter-deck sounded in her
      ears. It did not come harshly to her, for it seemed to come from a world
      in which she had no part. The things about her were as the things of a
      dream. The reality in which she was living was that which she saw out in
      the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear,&rdquo; said a voice behind her&mdash;&ldquo;Come and walk with me on
      the deck. I fancied I had lost you, and you may guess what a state I was
      in, after all the promises I made to Mr. Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just looking out there, and wondering what they were all doing at
      home&mdash;at the foot of the dear old mountain,&rdquo; said Daireen, allowing
      herself to be led away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what most people would call moping, dear,&rdquo; said the lady who had
      come up. She was a middle-aged lady with a pleasant face, though her
      figure was hardly what a scrupulous painter would choose as a model for a
      Nausicaa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I was moping, Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; Daireen replied; &ldquo;but I feel the
      better for it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I don't disapprove of moping now and again, though as a habit it
      should not be encouraged. I was down in my cabin, and when I came on deck
      I couldn't understand where you had disappeared to. I asked the major, but
      of course, you know, he was quite oblivious to everything but the mutiny
      at Cawnpore, through being beside Doctor Campion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have found me, you see, Mrs. Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thanks to Mr. Glaston; he knew where you had gone; he had been
      watching you.&rdquo; Daireen felt her face turning red as she thought of this
      Mr. Glaston, whoever he was, with his eyes fixed upon her movements. &ldquo;You
      don't know Mr. Glaston, Daireen?&mdash;I shall call you 'Daireen' of
      course, though we have only known each other a couple of hours,&rdquo; continued
      the lady. &ldquo;No, of course you don't. Never mind, I'll show him to you.&rdquo; For
      the promise of this treat Daireen did not express her gratitude. She had
      come to think the most unfavourable things regarding this Mr. Glaston.
      Mrs. Crawford, however, did not seem to expect an acknowledgment. Her chat
      ran on as briskly as ever. &ldquo;I shall point him out to you, but on no
      account look near him for some time&mdash;young men are so conceited, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen had heard this peculiarity ascribed to the race before, and so
      when her guide, as they walked towards the stern of the vessel, indicated
      to her that a young man sitting in a deck-chair smoking a cigar was Mr.
      Glaston, she certainly did not do anything that might possibly increase in
      Mr. Glaston this dangerous tendency which Mrs. Crawford had assigned to
      young men generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of him, my dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Crawford, when they had
      strolled up the deck once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom?&rdquo; inquired Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious,&rdquo; cried the lady, &ldquo;are your thoughts still straying? Why, I
      mean Mr. Glaston, to be sure. What do you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't look at him,&rdquo; the girl answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford searched the fair face beside her to find out if its
      expression agreed with her words, and the scrutiny being satisfactory she
      gave a little laugh. &ldquo;How do you ever mean to know what he is like if you
      don't look at him?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen did not stop to explain how she thought it possible that
      contentment might exist aboard the steamer even though she remained in
      ignorance for ever of Mr. Glaston's qualities; but presently she glanced
      along the deck, and saw sitting at graceful ease upon the chair Mrs.
      Crawford had indicated, a tall man of apparently a year or two under
      thirty. He had black hair which he had allowed to grow long behind, and a
      black moustache which gave every indication of having been subjected to
      the most careful youthful training. His face would not have been thought
      expressive but for his eyes, and the expression that these organs gave out
      could hardly be called anything except a neutral one: they indicated
      nothing except that nothing was meant to be indicated by them. No
      suggestion of passion, feeling, or even thoughtfulness, did they give; and
      in fact the only possible result of looking at this face which some people
      called expressive, was a feeling that the man himself was calmly conscious
      of the fact that some people were in the habit of calling his face
      expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what <i>do</i> you think of him now, my dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Crawford,
      after Daireen had gratified her by taking that look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't think that I think anything,&rdquo; she answered with a little
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the beauty of his face,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;It sets one
      thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not what I said, Mrs. Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you did not think you were thinking anything, Daireen; and that
      meant, I know, that there was more in his face than you could read at a
      first glance. Never mind; every one is set thinking when one sees Mr.
      Glaston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen had almost become interested in this Mr. Glaston, even though she
      could not forget that he had watched her when she did not want to be
      watched. She gave another glance towards him, but with no more profitable
      conclusion than her previous look had attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you all about him, my child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford
      confidentially; &ldquo;but first let us make ourselves comfortable. Dear old
      England, there is the last of it for us for some time. Adieu, adieu, dear
      old country!&rdquo; There was not much sentimentality in the stout little lady's
      tone, as she looked towards the faint line of mist far astern that marked
      the English coast. She sat down with Daireen to the leeward of the
      deck-house where she had laid her rugs, and until the tea-bell rang
      Daireen had certainly no opportunity for moping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford told her that this Mr. Glaston was a young man of such
      immense capacities that nothing lay outside his grasp either in art or
      science. He had not thought it necessary to devote his attention to any
      subject in particular; but that, Mrs. Crawford thought, was rather because
      there existed no single subject that he considered worthy of an
      expenditure of all his energies. As things unfortunately existed, there
      was nothing left for him but to get rid of the unbounded resources of his
      mind by applying them to a variety of subjects. He had, in fact, written
      poetry&mdash;never an entire volume of course, but exceedingly clever
      pieces that had been published in his college magazine. He was capable of
      painting a great picture if he chose, though he had contented himself with
      giving ideas to other men who had worked them out through the medium of
      pictures. He was one of the most accomplished of musicians; and if he had
      not yet produced an opera or composed even a song, instances were on
      record of his having performed impromptus that would undoubtedly have made
      the fame of a professor. He was the son of a Colonial Bishop, Mrs.
      Crawford told Daireen, and though he lived in England he was still dutiful
      enough to go out to pay a month's visit to his father every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must not make him conceited, Daireen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, ending
      her discourse; &ldquo;we must not, dear; and if he should look over and see us
      together this way, he would conclude that we were talking of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen rose with her instructive companion with an uneasy sense of
      feeling that all they could by their combined efforts contribute to the
      conceit of a young man who would, upon grounds so slight, come to such a
      conclusion as Mrs. Crawford feared he might, would be but trifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the tea-bell rang, and all the novices who had enjoyed the roast pork
      and dumplings at dinner, descended to make a hearty meal of buttered toast
      and banana jelly. The sea air had given them an appetite, they declared
      with much merriment. The chief steward, however, being an experienced man,
      and knowing that in a few hours the Bay of Biscay would be entered, did
      not, from observing the hearty manner in which the novices were eating,
      feel uneasy on the matter of the endurance of the ship's stores. He knew
      it would be their last meal for some days at least, and he smiled grimly
      as he laid down another plate of buttered toast, and hastened off to send
      up some more brandy and biscuits to Major Crawford and Doctor Campion,
      whose hoarse chuckles called forth by pleasing reminiscences of Cawnpore
      were dimly heard from the deck through the cabin skylight.

      absolutely clung to Daireen all this evening. When the whist parties were
      formed in the cabin she brought the girl on deck and instructed her in
      some of the matters worth knowing aboard a passenger ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On no account bind yourself to any whist set before you look about you:
      nothing could be more dangerous,&rdquo; she said confidentially. &ldquo;Just think how
      terrible it would be if you were to join a set now, and afterwards to find
      out that it was not the best set. You would simply be ruined. Besides

      So Daireen found herself borne onward with Mrs. Crawford's arm in her own

      deck-chairs lighting fresh cheroots from the ashes of the expiring ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tread on the tumblers, my dear,&rdquo; said the major as his wife

      &ldquo;Just a single cup, and very weak,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I thought you were wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take this chair, Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo; said Doctor Campion, without
      making the least pretence of moving, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think of such a thing,&rdquo; cried the lady's husband; and to do Doctor
      Campion justice, he did not think of such a thing. &ldquo;Why, you don't fancy
      these are our Junkapore days, do you, when Kate came out to our bungalow,
      and the boys called her the Sylph? It's a fact, Miss Gerald; my wife, as
      your father will tell you, was as slim as a lily. Ah, dear, dear! Time,
      they say, takes a lot away from us, but by Jingo, he's liberal enough in
      some ways. By Jingo, yes,&rdquo; and the gallant old man kept shaking his head
      and chuckling towards his comrade, whose features could be seen puckered
      into a grin though he uttered no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And stranger still, Miss Gerald,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;the major was once
      looked upon as a polite man, and politer to his wife than to anybody else.
      Go and fetch some chairs here, Campion, like a good fellow,&rdquo; she added to
      the doctor, who rose slowly and obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's how my wife takes command of the entire battalion, Miss Gerald,&rdquo;
       remarked the major. &ldquo;Oh, your father will tell you all about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constant reference to her father by one who was an old friend, came
      with a cheering influence to the girl. A terrible question as to what
      might be the result of her arrival at the Cape had suggested itself to her
      more than once since she had left Ireland; but now the major did not seem
      to fancy that there could be any question in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the chairs were brought, and enveloped in karosses, as the old
      campaigners called the furs, there arose a chatter of bungalows, and
      punkahs, and puggarees, and calapashes, and curries, that was quite
      delightful to the girl's ears, especially as from time to time her
      father's name would be mentioned in connection with some elephant-trapping
      expedition, or, perhaps, a mess joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last Daireen found herself alone in the cabin which her
      grandfather had managed to secure for her, she did not feel that
      loneliness which she thought she should have felt aboard this ship full of
      strangers without sympathy for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood for a short time in the darkness, looking out of her cabin port
      over the long waters, and listening to the sound of the waves hurrying
      away from the ship and flapping against its sides, and once more she
      thought of the purple mountain and the green Irish Lough. Then as she
      moved away from the port her thoughts stretched in another direction&mdash;southward.
      Her heart was full of hope as she turned in to her bunk and went quietly
      asleep just as the first waves of the Bay of Biscay were making the good
      steamer a little uneasy, and bringing about a bitter remorse to those who
      had made merry over the dumplings and buttered toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Crawford was an officer who had served for a good many years in
      India, and had there become acquainted with Daireen's father and mother.
      When Mr. Gerald was holding his grandchild in his arms aboard the steamer
      saying good-bye, he was surprised by a strange lady coming up to him and
      begging to be informed if it was possible that Daireen was the daughter of
      Colonel Gerald. In another instant Mr. Gerald was overjoyed to know that
      Daireen would be during the entire voyage in the company of an officer and
      his wife who were old friends of her father, and had recognised her from
      her likeness to her mother, whom they had also known when she was little
      older than Daireen. Mr. Gerald left the vessel with a mind at rest; and
      that his belief that the girl would be looked after was well-founded is
      already known. Daireen was, indeed, in the hands of a lady who was noted
      in many parts of the world for her capacities for taking charge of young
      ladies. When she was in India her position at the station was very
      similiar to that of immigration-agent-general. Fond matrons in England,
      who had brought their daughters year after year to Homburg, Kissingen, and
      Nice, in the &ldquo;open&rdquo; season, and had yet brought them back in safety&mdash;matrons
      who had even sunk to the low level of hydropathic hunting-grounds without
      success, were accustomed to write pathetic letters to Junkapore and
      Arradambad conveying to Mrs. Crawford intelligence of the strange fancy
      that some of the dear girls had conceived to visit those parts of the
      Indian Empire, and begging Mrs. Crawford to give her valuable advice with
      regard to the carrying out of such remarkable freaks. Never in any of
      these cases had the major's wife failed. These forlorn hopes took passage
      to India and found in her a real friend, with tact, perseverance, and
      experience. The subalterns of the station were never allowed to mope in a
      wretched, companionless condition; and thus Mrs. Crawford had achieved for
      herself a certain fame, which it was her study to maintain. Having herself
      had men-children only, she had no personal interests to look after. Her
      boys had been swaddled in puggarees, spoon-fed with curry, and nurtured
      upon chutney, and had so developed into full-grown Indians ready for the
      choicest appointments, and they had succeeded very well indeed. Her
      husband had now received a command from the War Office to proceed to the
      Cape for the purpose of obtaining evidence on the subject of the
      regulation boots to be supplied to troops on active foreign service; a
      commission upon this most important subject having been ordered by a
      Parliamentary vote. Other officers of experience had been sent to various
      of the colonies, and much was expected to result from the prosecution of
      their inquiries, the opponents of the Government being confident that
      gussets would eventually be allowed to non-commissioned officers, and back
      straps to privates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Major Crawford could not set out on a mission so important
      without the companionship of his wife. Though just at the instant of
      Daireen's turning in, the major fancied he might have managed to get along
      pretty well even if his partner had been left behind him in England. He
      was inclined to snarl in his cabin at nights when his wife unfolded her
      plans to him and kept him awake to give his opinion as to the possibility
      of the tastes of various young persons becoming assimilated. To-night the
      major expressed his indifference as to whether every single man in the
      ship's company got married to every single woman before the end of the
      voyage, or whether they all went to perdition singly. He concluded by
      wishing fervently that they would disappear, married and single, by a
      supernatural agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think, how gratified poor Gerald would be if the dear girl could
      think as I do on this subject,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford persistently, alluding
      to the matter of certain amalgamation of tastes. At this point, however,
      the major expressed himself in words still more vigorous than he had
      brought to his aid before, and his wife thought it prudent to get into her
      bunk without pursuing any further the question of the possible
      gratification of Colonel Gerald at the unanimity of thought existing
      between his daughter and Mrs. Crawford.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE uneasy bosom of
      the Bay of Biscay was throbbing with its customary emotion beneath the
      good vessel, when Daireen awoke the next morning to the sound of creaking
      timbers and rioting glasses. Above her on the deck the tramp of a healthy
      passenger, who wore a pedometer and walked three miles every morning
      before breakfast, was heard, now dilating and now decreasing, as he passed
      over the cabins. He had almost completed his second mile, and was putting
      on a spurt in order to keep himself up to time; his spurt at the end of
      the first mile had effectually awakened all the passengers beneath, who
      had yet remained undisturbed through the earlier part of his tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford, looking bright and fresh and good-natured, entered
      Daireen's cabin before the girl was ready to leave it. She certainly
      seemed determined that the confidence Mr. Gerald had reposed in her with
      regard to the care of his granddaughter should not prove to have been
      misplaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going in, my dear,&rdquo; she said as she entered the cabin. &ldquo;I only
      stepped round to see that you were all right this morning. I knew you
      would be so, though Robinson the steward tells me that even the little sea
      there is on in the bay has been quite sufficient to make about a dozen
      vacancies at the breakfast-table. People are such fools when they come
      aboard a ship&mdash;eating boiled paste and all sorts of things, and so
      the sea is grossly misrepresented. Did that dreadfully healthy Mr.
      Thompson awake you with his tramping on deck? Of course he did; he's a
      dreadful man. If he goes on like this we'll have to petition the captain
      to lay down bark on the deck. Now I'll leave you. Come aloft when you are
      ready; and, by the way, you must take care what dress you put on&mdash;very
      great care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought that aboard ship one might wear anything,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was there a greater mistake, my child. People say the same about
      going to the seaside: anything will do; but you know how one requires to
      be doubly particular there; and it's just the same in our little world
      aboard ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You quite frighten me, Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;What advice can you
      give me on the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford was thoughtful. &ldquo;If you had only had time to prepare for the
      voyage, and I had been beside you, everything might have been different.
      You must not wear anything pronounced&mdash;any distinct colour: you must
      find out something undecided&mdash;you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen looked puzzled. &ldquo;I'm sorry to say I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have surely something of pale sage&mdash;no, that is a bad tone
      for the first days aboard&mdash;too like the complexions of most of the
      passengers&mdash;but, chocolate-gray? ah, that should do: have you
      anything in that to do for a morning dress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen was so extremely fortunate as to be possessed of a garment of the
      required tone, and her kind friend left her arraying herself in its folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On going aloft Daireen found the deck occupied by a select few of the
      passengers. The healthy gentleman was just increasing his pace for the
      final hundred yards of his morning's walk, and Doctor Campion had got very
      near the end of his second cheroot, while he sat talking to a fair-haired
      and bronze-visaged man with clear gray eyes that had such a way of looking
      at things as caused people to fancy he was making a mental calculation of
      the cubic measure of everything; and it was probably the recollection of
      their peculiarity that made people fancy, when these eyes looked into a
      human face, that the mind of the man was going through a similar
      calculation with reference to the human object: one could not avoid
      feeling that he had a number of formulas for calculating the intellectual
      value of people, and that when he looked at a person he was thinking which
      formula should be employed for arriving at a conclusion regarding that
      person's mental capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford was chatting with the doctor and his companion, but on
      Daireen's appearing, she went over to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect, my child,&rdquo; she said in a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;the tone of the dress, I
      mean; it will work wonders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Daireen was reflecting upon the possibility of a suspension of the
      laws of nature being the result of the appearance of the chocolate-toned
      dress, she was led towards the doctor, who immediately went through a
      fiction of rising from his seat as she approached; and one would really
      have fancied that he intended getting upon his feet, and was only
      restrained at the last moment by a remonstrance of the girl's. Daireen
      acknowledged his courtesy, though it was only imaginary, and she was
      conscious that his companion had really risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't made the acquaintance of Miss Gerald, Mr. Harwood?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not had the honour,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me present you, Daireen. Mr. Harwood&mdash;Miss Gerald. Now take
      great care what you say to this gentleman, Daireen; he is a dangerous man&mdash;the
      most dangerous that any one could meet. He is a detective, dear, and the
      worst of all&mdash;a literary detective; the 'special' of the <i>Domnant
      Trumpeter</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen had looked into the man's face while she was being presented to
      him, and she knew it was the face of a man who had seen the people of more
      than one nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not your first voyage, Miss Gerald, or you would not be on deck
      so early?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is not,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I was born in India, so that my first
      voyage was to England; then I have crossed the Irish Channel frequently,
      going to school and returning for the holidays; and I have also had some
      long voyages on Lough Suangorm,&rdquo; she added with a little smile, for she
      did not think that her companion would be likely to have heard of the
      existence of the Irish fjord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suangorm? then you have had some of the most picturesque voyages one can
      make in the course of a day in this world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lough Suangorm is
      the most wonderful fjord in the world, let me tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know it,&rdquo; she cried with a good deal of surprise. &ldquo;You must know
      the dear old lough or you would not talk so.&rdquo; She did not seem to think
      that his assertion should imply that he had seen a good many other fjords
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I may say I know it. Yes, from those fine headlands that the
      Atlantic beats against, to where the purple slope of that great hill meets
      the little road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the hill&mdash;old Slieve Docas? How strange! I live just at the
      foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a sketch of a mansion, taken just there,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;It
      is of a dark brown exterior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks towards the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is exceedingly picturesque.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Picturesque?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes; the house I allude to is very much so. If I recollect aright,
      the one window of the wall was not glazed, and the smoke certainly found
      its way out through a hole in the roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is too bad,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;I had no idea that the peculiarities
      of my country people would be known so far away. Please don't say anything
      about that sketch to the passengers aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never be tempted to allude, even by the 'pronouncing of some
      doubtful phrase,' to the&mdash;the&mdash;peculiarities of your country
      people, Miss Gerald,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It is a lovely country, and contains
      the most hospitable people in the world; but their talent does not develop
      itself architecturally. Ah! there is the second bell. I hope you have an
      appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been guarded enough in your conversation, Daireen?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Crawford, coming up with the doctor, whose rising at the summons of the
      breakfast-bell was by no means a fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The secrets of the Home Rule Confederation are safe in the keeping of
      Miss Gerald,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood, with a smile which any one could see was
      simply the result of his satisfaction at having produced a well-turned
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast-table was very thinly attended, more so even than Robinson
      the steward had anticipated when on the previous evening he had laid down
      that second plate of buttered toast before the novices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the young ladies only three appeared at the table, and their
      complexions were of the softest amber shade that was ever worked in satin
      in the upholstery of mock-mediæval furniture. Major Crawford had just come
      out of the steward's pantry, and he greeted Daireen with all courtesy, as
      indeed he did the other young ladies at the table, for the major was
      gallant and gay aboard ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      After every one had been seated for about ten minutes, the curtain that
      screened off one of the cabin entrances from the saloon was moved aside,
      and the figure of the young man to whom Mrs. Crawford had alluded as Mr.
      Glaston appeared. He came slowly forward, nodding to the captain and
      saying good-morning to Mrs. Crawford, while he elevated his eyebrows in
      recognition of Mr. Harwood, taking his seat at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't have an appetite coming directly out of your bunk,&rdquo; said the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston, without the least expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite impossible,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You should have been up an hour ago
      at least. Here is Mr. Thompson, who has walked more than three miles in
      the open air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the other, never moving his eyes to see the modest smile that
      spread itself over the features of the exemplary Mr. Thompson. &ldquo;Ah, I
      heard some one who seemed to be going in for that irrepressible thousand
      miles in a thousand hours. Yes, bring me a pear and a grape.&rdquo; The last
      sentence he addressed to the waiter, who, having been drilled by the
      steward on the subject of Mr. Glaston's tastes, did not show any
      astonishment at being asked for fruit instead of fish, but hastened off to
      procure the grape and the pear.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Glaston was waiting he glanced across the table, and gave a
      visible start as his eyes rested upon one of the young ladies&mdash;a
      pleasant-looking girl wearing a pink dress and having a blue ribbon in her
      hair. Mr. Glaston gave a little shudder, and then turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That face&mdash;ah, where have I beheld it?&rdquo; muttered Mr. Harwood to the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dam puppy!&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the plate and fruit were laid before Mr. Glaston, who said quickly,
      &ldquo;Take them away.&rdquo; The bewildered waiter looked towards his chief and
      obeyed, so that Mr. Glaston remained with an empty plate. Robinson became
      uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I get you anything, sir?&mdash;we have three peaches aboard and a
      pine-apple,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't touch anything now, Robinson,&rdquo; Mr. Glaston answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor is right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;You have no appetite, Mr.
      Glaston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;not <i>now</i>,&rdquo; and he gave the least glance towards
      the girl in pink, who began to feel that all her school dreams of going
      forth into the world of men to conquer and overcome were being realised
      beyond her wildest anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a pause at the table, which the good major broke by
      suddenly inquiring something of the captain. Mr. Glaston, however, sat
      silent, and somewhat sad apparently, until the breakfast was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen went into her cabin for a book, and remained arranging some
      volumes on the little shelf for a few minutes. Mr. Glaston was on deck
      when she ascended, and he was engaged in a very serious conversation with
      Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something must be done. Surely she has a guardian aboard who is not so
      utterly lost to everything of truth and right as to allow that to go on
      unchecked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words Daireen could make out as she passed the young man and the
      major's wife, and the girl began to fear that something terrible was about
      to happen. But Mr. Harwood, who was standing above the major's chair,
      hastened forward as she appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Major Crawford has been telling me that your father is Colonel
      Gerald,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Crawford never mentioned that fact, thinking that
      I should be able to guess it for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know papa?&rdquo; Daireen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him several times when I was out about the Baroda affair,&rdquo; said the
      &ldquo;special.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as you are his daughter, I suppose it will interest you to know that
      he has been selected as the first governor of the Castaways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen looked puzzled. &ldquo;The Castaways?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Gerald; the lovely Castaway Islands which, you know, have just
      been annexed by England. Colonel Gerald has been chosen by the Colonial
      Secretary as the first governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I heard nothing of this,&rdquo; said Daireen, a little astonished to
      receive such information in the Bay of Biscay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you hear anything of it? No one outside the Cabinet has the
      least idea of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said the girl doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Miss Gerald, the resources of information possessed by the <i>Dominant
      Trumpeter</i> are as unlimited as they are trustworthy. You may depend
      upon what I tell you. It is not generally known that I am now bound for
      the Castaway group, to make the British public aware of the extent of the
      treasure they have acquired in these sunny isles. But I understood that
      Colonel Gerald was on his way from Madras?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen explained how her father came to be at the Cape, and Mr. Harwood
      gave her a few cheering words regarding his sickness. She was greatly
      disappointed when their conversation was interrupted by Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor fellow!&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Glaston, I mean. I have induced him
      to go down and eat some grapes and a pear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn't he take them at breakfast and not betray his idiocy?&rdquo; said
      Mr. Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harwood, you have no sympathy for sufferers from sensitiveness,&rdquo;
       replied the lady. &ldquo;Poor Mr. Glaston! he had an excellent appetite, but he
      found it impossible to touch anything the instant he saw that fearful pink
      dress with the blue ribbon hanging over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dam puppy!&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Campion!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons! my dear Miss Gerald,&rdquo; said the transgressor. &ldquo;But
      what can a man say when he hears of such puppyism? This is my third voyage
      with that young man, and he has been developing into the full-grown puppy
      with the greatest rapidity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no fine feeling, Campion,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;You have got no
      sympathy for those who are artistically sensitive. But hush! here is the
      offending person herself, and with such a hat! Now admit that to look at
      her sends a cold shudder through you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think her a devilish pretty little thing, by gad,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady with the pink dress and the blue ribbon appeared, wearing
      the additional horror of a hat lined with yellow and encircled with mighty
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something must be done to suppress her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford decisively.
      &ldquo;Surely such people must have a better side to their natures that one may
      appeal to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it, Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood, with only the least tinge
      of sarcasm in his voice. &ldquo;I admit that one might not have been in utter
      despair though the dress was rather aggressive, but I cannot see anything
      but depravity in that hat with those floral splendours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is to be done?&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Mr. Glaston would, no doubt,
      advocate making a Jonah of that young person for the sake of saving the
      rest of the ship's company. But, however just that might be, I do not
      suppose it would be considered strictly legal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many acts of justice are done that are not legal,&rdquo; replied Harwood
      gravely. &ldquo;From a legal standpoint, Cain was no murderer&mdash;his accuser
      being witness and also judge. He would leave the court without a stain on
      his character nowadays. Meantime, major, suppose we have a smoke on the
      bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He fancies he has said something clever,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Crawford when he
      had walked away; and it must be confessed that Mr. Harwood had a suspicion
      to that effect.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE information
      which Daireen had received on the unimpeachable authority of the special
      correspondent of the <i>Dominant Trumpeter</i> was somewhat puzzling to
      her at first; but as she reflected upon the fact hat the position of
      governor of the newly-acquired Castaway group must be one of importance,
      she could not help feeling some happiness; only in the midmost heart of
      her joy her recollection clasped a single grief&mdash;-a doubt about her
      father was still clinging to her heart. The letter her grandfather had
      received which caused her to make up her mind to set out for the Cape,
      merely stated that Colonel Gerald had been found too weak to continue the
      homeward voyage in the vessel that had brought him from India. He had a
      bad attack of fever, and was not allowed to be moved from where he lay at
      the Cape. The girl thought over all of this as she reflected upon what Mr.
      Harwood had told her, and looking over the long restless waters of the Bay
      of Biscay from her seat far astern, her eyes became very misty; the
      unhappy author represented by the yellow-covered book which she had been
      reading lay neglected upon her knee. But soon her brave, hopeful heart
      took courage, and she began to paint in her imagination the fairest
      pictures of the future&mdash;a future beneath the rich blue sky that was
      alleged by the Ministers who had brought about the annexation, evermore to
      overshadow the Castaway group&mdash;a future beneath the purple shadow of
      the giant Slieve Docas when her father would have discharged his duties at
      the Castaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not even pretend to herself to be reading the book she had
      brought up, so that Mrs. Crawford could not have been accused of an
      interruption when she drew her chair alongside the girl's, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have a little chat together, now that there is a chance for it.
      It is really terrible how much time one can fritter away aboard ship. I
      have known people take long voyages for the sake of study, and yet never
      open a single book but a novel. By the way, what is this the major has
      been telling me Harwood says about your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen repeated all that Harwood had said regarding the new island
      colony, and begged Mrs. Crawford to give an opinion as to the
      trustworthiness of the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, &ldquo;you may depend upon its truth if
      Harwood told it to you. The <i>Dominant Trumpeter</i> sends out as many
      arms as an octopus, for news, and, like the octopus too, it has the
      instinct of only making use of what is worth anything. The Government have
      been very good to George&mdash;I mean Colonel Gerald&mdash;he was always
      'George' with us when he was lieutenant. The Castaway governorship is one
      of the nice things they sometimes have to dispose of to the deserving. It
      was thought, you know, that George would sell out and get his brevet long
      ago, but what he often said to us after your poor mother died convinced me
      that he would not accept a quiet life. And so it was Mr. Harwood that gave
      you this welcome news,&rdquo; she continued, adding in a thoughtful tone, &ldquo;By
      the way, what do you think of Mr. Harwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really have not thought anything about him,&rdquo; Daireen replied, wondering
      if it was indeed a necessity of life aboard ship to be able at a moment's
      notice to give a summary of her opinion as to the nature of every person
      she might chance to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very nice man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford; &ldquo;only just inclined to be
      conceited, don't you think? This is our third voyage with him, so that we
      know something of him. One knows more of a person at the end of a week at
      sea than after a month ashore. What can be keeping Mr. Glaston over his
      pears, I wonder? I meant to have presented him to you before. Ah, here he
      comes out of the companion. I asked him to return to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But again Mrs. Crawford's expectations were dashed to the ground. Mr.
      Glaston certainly did appear on deck, and showed some sign in a languid
      way of walking over to where Mrs. Crawford was sitting, but unfortunately
      before he had taken half a dozen steps he caught sight of that terrible
      pink dress and the hat with the jaundiced interior. He stopped short, and
      a look of martyrdom passed over his face as he turned and made his way to
      the bridge in the opposite direction to where that horror of pronounced
      tones sat quite unconscious of the agony her appearance was creating in
      the aesthetic soul of the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen having glanced up and seen the look of dismay upon his face, and
      the flight of Mr. Glaston, could not avoid laughing outright so soon as he
      had disappeared. But Mrs. Crawford did not laugh. On the contrary she
      looked very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is terrible&mdash;terrible, Daireen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That vile hat has
      driven him away. I knew it must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matters are getting serious indeed,&rdquo; said the girl, with only the least
      touch of mockery in her voice. &ldquo;If he is not allowed to eat anything at
      breakfast in sight of the dress, and he is driven up to the bridge by a
      glimpse of the hat, I am afraid that his life will not be quite happy
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy! my dear, you cannot conceive the agonies he endures through his
      sensitiveness. I must make the acquaintance of that young person and try
      to bring her to see the error of her ways. Oh, how fortunate you had this
      chocolate-gray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have thought of it in a moment of inspiration,&rdquo; said Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you really mustn't laugh,&rdquo; said the elder lady reprovingly. &ldquo;It was
      a happy thought, at any rate, and I only hope that you will be able to
      sustain its effect by something good at dinner. I must look over your
      trunks and tell you what tone is most artistic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen began to feel rebellious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Crawford, it is very kind of you to offer to take so much
      trouble; but, you see, I do not feel it to be a necessity to choose the
      shade of my dress solely to please the taste of a gentleman who may not be
      absolutely perfect in his ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford laughed. &ldquo;Do not get angry, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I admire
      your spirit, and I will not attempt to control your own good taste; you
      will never, I am sure, sink to such a depth of depravity as is manifested
      by that hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you may depend on me so far,&rdquo; said Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards Mrs. Crawford descended to arrange some matters in her
      cabin, and Daireen had consequently an opportunity of returning to her
      neglected author.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before she had made much progress in her study she was again
      interrupted, and this time by Doctor Campion, who had been smoking with
      Mr. Harwood on the ship's bridge. Doctor Campion was a small man, with a
      reddish face upon which a perpetual frown was resting. He had a jerky way
      of turning his head as if it was set upon a ratchet wheel only capable of
      shifting a tooth at a time. He had been in the army for a good many years,
      and had only accepted the post aboard the <i>Cardwell Castle</i> for the
      sake of his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young cub!&rdquo; he muttered, as he came up to Daireen. &ldquo;Infernal young cub!&mdash;I
      beg your pardon, Miss Gerald, but I really must say it. That fellow
      Glaston is getting out of all bounds. Ah, it's his father's fault&mdash;his
      father's fault. Keeps him dawdling about England without any employment.
      Why, it would have been better for him to have taken to the Church, as
      they call it, at once, idle though the business is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you have not been wearing an inartistic tie, Doctor Campion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inartistic indeed! The puppy has got so much cant on his finger-ends that
      weak-minded people think him a genius. Don't you believe it, my dear; he's
      a dam puppy&mdash;excuse me, but there's really no drawing it mild here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen was amused at the doctor's vehemence, however shocked she may have
      been at his manner of getting rid of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth has happened with Mr. Glaston now?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It is
      impossible that there could be another obnoxious dress aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't given himself any airs in that direction since,&rdquo; said the
      doctor. &ldquo;But he came up to the bridge where we were smoking, and after he
      had talked for a minute with Harwood, he started when he saw a boy who had
      been sent up to clean out one of the hencoops&mdash;asked if we didn't
      think his head marvellously like Carlyle's&mdash;was amazed at our want of
      judgment&mdash;went up to the boy and cross-questioned him&mdash;found out
      that his father sells vegetables to the Victoria Docks&mdash;asked if it
      had ever been remarked before that his head was like Carlyle's&mdash;boy
      says quickly that if the man he means is the tailor in Wapping, anybody
      that says his head is like that man's is a liar, and then boy goes quietly
      down. 'Wonderful!' says our genius, as he comes over to us; 'wonderful
      head&mdash;exactly the same as Carlyle's, and language marvellously
      similar&mdash;brief&mdash;earnest&mdash;emphatic&mdash;full of powah!'
      Then he goes on to say he'll take notes of the boy's peculiarities and
      send them to a magazine. I couldn't stand any more of that sort of thing,
      so I left him with Harwood. Harwood can sift him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen laughed at this new story of the young man whose movements seemed
      to be regarded as of so much importance by every one aboard the steamer.
      She began really to feel interested in this Mr. Glaston; and she thought
      that perhaps she might as well be particular about the tone of the dress
      she would select for appearing in before the judicial eyes of this Mr.
      Glaston. She relinquished the design she had formed in her mind while Mrs.
      Crawford was urging on her the necessity for discrimination in this
      respect: she had resolved to show a recklessness in her choice of a dress,
      but now she felt that she had better take Mrs. Crawford's advice, and give
      some care to the artistic combinations of her toilette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of her decision was that she appeared in such studious
      carelessness of attire that Mr. Glaston, sitting opposite to her, was
      enabled to eat a hearty dinner utterly regardless of the aggressive
      splendour of the imperial blue dress worn by the other young lady, with a
      pink ribbon flowing over it from her hair. This young lady's imagination
      was unequal to suggesting a more diversified arrangement than she had
      already shown. She thought it gave evidence of considerable strategical
      resources to wear that pink ribbon over the blue dress: it was very nearly
      as effective as the blue ribbon over the pink, of the morning. The
      appreciation of contrast as an important element of effect in art was very
      strongly developed in this young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford did not conceal the satisfaction she felt observing the
      appetite of Mr. Glaston; and after dinner she took his arm as he went
      towards the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you were not offended with that dreadful young person's
      hideous colours,&rdquo; she said, as they strolled along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could hardly have believed it possible that such wickedness could
      survive nowadays,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I was, after the first few minutes,
      quite unconscious of its enormity. My dear Mrs. Crawford, your young
      protégée appeared as a spirit of light to charm away that fiend of evil.
      She sat before me&mdash;a poem of tones&mdash;a delicate symphony of
      Schumann's played at twilight on the brink of a mere of long reeds and
      water-flags, with a single star shining through the well-defined twigs of
      a solitary alder. That was her idea, don't you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it,&rdquo; the lady replied after a little pause. &ldquo;But if
      you allow me to present you to her you will have an opportunity of finding
      out. Now do let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this evening, Mrs. Crawford; I do not feel equal to it,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;She has given me too much to think about&mdash;too many ideas to work
      out. That was the most thoughtful and pure-souled toilette I ever
      recollect; but there are a few points about it I do not fully grasp,
      though I have an instinct of their meaning. No, I want a quiet hour alone.
      But you will do me the favour to thank the child for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would come and do it yourself,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;But I suppose
      there is no use attempting to force you. If you change your mind, remember
      that we shall be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the young man preparing a cigarette, and joined Daireen and the
      major, who were sitting far astern: the girl with that fiction of a
      fiction still in her hand; her companion with a cheroot that was anything
      but insubstantial in his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Crawford, &ldquo;I am so glad you took your own
      way and would not allow me to choose your dress for you. I could never
      have dreamt of anything so perfect and&mdash;&mdash;yes, it is far beyond
      what I could have composed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford thought it better on the whole not to transfer to Daireen
      the expression of gratitude Mr. Glaston had begged to be conveyed to her.
      She had an uneasy consciousness that such a message coming to one who was
      as yet unacquainted with Mr. Glaston might give her the impression that he
      was inclined to have some of that unhappy conceit, with the possession of
      which Mrs. Crawford herself had accredited the race generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Gerald is an angel in whatever dress she may wear,&rdquo; said the major
      gallantly. &ldquo;What is dress, after all?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;By gad, my dear, the
      finest women I ever recollect seeing were in Burmah, and all the dress
      they wore was the merest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major, you forget yourself,&rdquo; cried his wife severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major pulled vigorously at the end of his moustache, grinning and
      bobbing his head towards the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad, my dear, the recollection of those beauties would make any fellow
      forget not only himself but his own wife, even if she was as fine a woman
      as yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's face relapsed into its accustomed frown after he had given a
      responsive grin and a baritone chuckle to the delicate pleasantry of his
      old comrade.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HO does not know
      the delightful monotony of a voyage southward, broken only at the
      intervals of anchoring beneath the brilliant green slopes of Madeira or
      under the grim shadow of the cliffs of St. Helena?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first week of the voyage for those who are not sensitive of the uneasy
      motion of the ship through the waves of the Bay of Biscay is perhaps the
      most delightful, for then every one is courteous with every one else. The
      passengers have not become friendly enough to be able to quarrel
      satisfactorily. The young ladies have got a great deal of white about
      them, and they have not begun to show that jealousy of each other which
      the next fortnight so powerfully develops. The men, too, are prodigal in
      their distribution of cigars; and one feels in one's own heart nothing but
      the most generous emotions, as one sits filling a meerschaum with Latakia
      in the delicate twilight of time and of thought that succeeds the curried
      lobster and pilau chickens as prepared in the galley of such ships as the
      <i>Cardwell Castle</i>. Certainly for a week of Sabbaths a September
      voyage to Madeira must be looked to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things had begun to arrange themselves aboard the <i>Cardwell Castle</i>.
      The whist sets and the deck sets had been formed. The far-stretching arm
      of society had at least one finger in the construction of the laws of life
      in this Atlantic ship-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman with the pronounced tastes in colour and the large
      resources of imagination in the arrangement of blue and pink had become
      less aggressive, as she was compelled to fall back upon the minor glories
      of her trunk, so that there was no likelihood of Mr. Glaston's perishing
      of starvation. Though very fond of taking-up young ladies, Mrs. Crawford
      had no great struggle with her propensity so far as this young lady was
      concerned. But as Mr. Glaston had towards the evening of the third day of
      the voyage found himself in a fit state of mind to be presented to Miss
      Gerald, Mrs. Crawford had nothing to complain of. She knew that the young
      man was invariably fascinating to all of her sex, and she could see no
      reason why Miss Gerald should not have at least the monotony of the voyage
      relieved for her through the improving nature of his conversation. To be
      sure, Mr. Harwood also possessed in his conversation many elements of
      improvement, but then they were of a more commonplace type in Mrs.
      Crawford's eyes, and she thought it as well, now and again when he was
      sitting beside Daireen, to make a third to their party and assist in the
      solution of any question they might be discussing. She rather wished that
      it had not been in Mr. Harwood's power to give Daireen that information
      about her father's appointment; it was a sort of link of friendship
      between him and the girl; but Mrs. Crawford recollected her own
      responsibility with regard to Daireen too well to allow such a frail link
      to become a bond to bind with any degree of force.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just making a mental resolution to this effect upon the day
      preceding their expected arrival at Madeira, when Mr. Harwood, who had
      before tiffin been showing the girl how to adjust a binocular glass,
      strolled up to where the major's wife sat resolving many things,
      reflecting upon her victories in quarter-deck campaigns of the past and
      laying out her tactics for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is our third voyage together, is it not, Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Yes, it is our third. Dear, dear, how time
      runs past us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it did run past us; unfortunately it seems to remain to work some
      of its vengeance upon each of us. But do you think we ever had a more
      charming voyage so far as this has run, Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady became thoughtful. &ldquo;That was a very nice trip in the P. &amp;
      O.'s <i>Turcoman</i>, when Mr. Carpingham of the Gunners proposed to Clara
      Walton before he landed at Aden,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Curiously enough, I was
      thinking about that very voyage just before you came up now. General
      Walton had placed Clara in my care, and it was I who presented her to
      young Carpingham.&rdquo; There was a slight tone of triumph in her voice as she
      recalled this victory of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember well,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood. &ldquo;How pleased every one was, and also
      how&mdash;well, the weather was extremely warm in the Red Sea just before
      he proposed. But I certainly think that this voyage is likely to be quite
      as pleasant. By the way, what a charming protégée you have got this time,
      Mrs. Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a dear girl indeed, and I hope that she may find her father all
      right at the Cape. Think of what she must suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood glanced round and saw that Mr. Glaston had strolled up to
      Daireen's chair. &ldquo;Yes, I have no doubt that she suffers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
      she is so gentle, so natural in her thoughts and in her manner, I should
      indeed be sorry that any trouble would come to her.&rdquo; He was himself
      speaking gently now&mdash;so gently, in fact, that Mrs. Crawford drew her
      lips together with a slight pressure. &ldquo;Perhaps it is because I am so much
      older than she that she talks to me naturally as she would to her father.
      I am old enough to be her father, I suppose,&rdquo; he added almost mournfully.
      But this only made the lady's lips become more compressed. She had heard
      men talk before now of being old enough to be young ladies' fathers, and
      she could also recollect instances of men who were actually old enough to
      be young ladies' grandfathers marrying those very young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, &ldquo;Daireen is a dear natural little thing.&rdquo; Into
      the paternal potentialities of Mr. Harwood's position towards this dear
      natural little thing Mrs. Crawford did not think it judicious to go just
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a dear child,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;By the way, we shall be at Funchal at
      noon to-morrow, and we do not leave until the evening. You will land, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I shall, I know every spot so well, and those bullock
      sleighs are so tiresome. I am not so young as I was when I first made
      their acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really, if that is your only plea, my dear Mrs. Crawford, we may
      count on your being in our party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our party!&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not say that until I get your consent,&rdquo; said Harwood quickly.
      &ldquo;Miss Gerald has never been at the island, you see, and she is girlishly
      eager to go ashore. Miss Butler and her mother are also landing&rdquo;&mdash;these
      were other passengers&mdash;&ldquo;and in a weak moment I volunteered my
      services as guide. Don't you think you can trust me so far as to agree to
      be one of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If Daireen wishes to go ashore you may
      depend upon my keeping her company. But you will have to provide a sleigh
      for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon the sleigh, Mrs. Crawford; and many thanks for your
      trusting to my guidance. Though I sleigh you yet you will trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harwood, that is dreadful. I am afraid that Mrs. Butler will need one
      of them also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The entire sleigh service shall be impressed if necessary,&rdquo; said the
      &ldquo;special,&rdquo; as he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford felt that she had not done anything rash. Daireen would, no
      doubt, be delighted with the day among the lovely heights of Madeira, and
      if by some little thoughtfulness it would be possible to hit upon a plan
      that should give over the guidance of some of the walking members of the
      party to Mr. Glaston, surely the matter was worth pursuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Glaston was just at this instant looking into, Daireen's face as he
      talked to her. He invariably kept his eyes fixed upon the faces of the
      young women to whom he was fond of talking. It did not argue any
      earnestness on his part, Mrs. Crawford knew. He seemed now, however, to be
      a little in earnest in what he was saying. But then Mrs. Crawford
      reflected that the subjects upon which his discourse was most impassioned
      were mostly those that other people would call trivial, such as the effect
      produced upon the mind of man by seeing a grape-green ribbon lying upon a
      pale amber cushion. &ldquo;Every colour has got its soul,&rdquo; she once heard him
      say; &ldquo;and though any one can appreciate its meaning and the work it has to
      perform in the world, the subtle thoughts breathed by the tones are too
      delicate to be understood except by a few. Colour is language of the
      subtlest nature, and one can praise God through that medium just as one
      can blaspheme through it.&rdquo; He had said this very earnestly at one time,
      she recollected, and as she now saw Daireen laugh she thought it was not
      impossible that it might be at some phrase of the same nature, the meaning
      of which her uncultured ear did not at once catch, that Daireen had
      laughed. Daireen, at any rate, did laugh in spite of his earnestness of
      visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments Mr. Glaston came over to Mrs. Crawford, and now his face
      wore an expression of sadness rather than of any other emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Crawford, you surely cannot intend to give your consent to
      that child's going ashore tomorrow. She tells me that that newspaper
      fellow has drawn her into a promise to land with a party&mdash;actually a
      party&mdash;and go round the place like a Cook's excursion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope we shall not be like that, Mr. Glaston,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not given your consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Daireen would enjoy it I do not see how I could avoid. Mr. Harwood was
      talking to me just now. He seems to think she will enjoy herself, as she
      has never seen the island before. Will you not be one of our party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Crawford, if you have got the least regard for me, do not say
      that word party; it means everything that is popular; it suggests
      unutterable horrors to me. No subsequent pleasure could balance the agony
      I should endure going ashore. Will you not try and induce that child to
      give up the idea? Tell her what dreadful taste it would be to join a party&mdash;that
      it would most certainly destroy her perceptions of beauty for months to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry I promised Mr. Harwood,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;if going ashore
      would do all of this it would certainly be better for Daireen to remain
      aboard. But they will be taking in coals here,&rdquo; she added, as the sudden
      thought struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can shut herself in her cabin and neither see nor hear anything
      offensive. Who but a newspaper man would think of suggesting to cultured
      people the possibility of enjoyment in a party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the newspaper man had strolled up to the place beside Daireen, which
      the aesthetic man had vacated. He knew something of the art of strategical
      defence, this newspaper man, and he was well aware that as he had got the
      promise of the major's wife, all the arguments that might be advanced by
      any one else would not cause him to be defrauded of the happiness of being
      by this girl's side in one of the loveliest spots of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will find out what Daireen thinks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, in reply to Mr.
      Glaston; and just then she turned and saw the newspaper man beside the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston; &ldquo;tell the poor child that it is
      impossible for her to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really cannot break my promise,&rdquo; replied the lady. &ldquo;We must be
      resigned, it will only be for a few hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the saddest thing I ever knew,&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston. &ldquo;She will lose
      all the ideas she was getting&mdash;all through being of a party. Good
      heavens, a party!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford could see that Mr. Glaston was annoyed at the presence of
      Harwood by the side of the girl, and she smiled, for she was too old a
      tactician not to be well aware of the value of a skeleton enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind of you to say you would not mind my going ashore,&rdquo; said Daireen,
      walking up to her. &ldquo;We shall enjoy ourselves I am sure, and Mr. Harwood
      knows every spot to take us to. I was afraid that Mr. Glaston might be
      talking to you as he was to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he spoke to me, but of course, my dear, if you think you would like
      to go ashore I shall not say anything but that I will be happy to take
      care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all that is good,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood. This was very pretty, the
      lady thought&mdash;very pretty indeed; but at the same time she was making
      up her mind that if the gentleman before her had conceived it probable
      that he should be left to exhibit any of the wonders of the island scenery
      to the girl, separate from the companionship of the girl's temporary
      guardian, he would certainly find out that he had reckoned without due
      regard to other contingencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadness was the only expression visible upon the face of Mr. Glaston for
      the remainder of this day; but upon the following morning this aspect had
      changed to one of contempt as he heard nearly all the cabin's company
      talking with expectancy of the joys of a few hours ashore. It was a great
      disappointment to him to observe the brightening of the face of Daireen
      Gerald, as Mr. Harwood came to tell her that the land was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen's face, however, did brighten. She went up to the ship's bridge,
      and Mr. Harwood, laying one hand upon her shoulder, pointed out with the
      other where upon the horizon lay a long, low, gray cloud. Mrs. Crawford
      observing his action, and being well aware that the girl's range of vision
      was not increased in the smallest degree by the touch of his fingers upon
      her shoulder, made a resolution that she herself would be the first to
      show Daireen the earliest view of St. Helena when they should be
      approaching that island.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there lay that group of cloud, and onward the good steamer sped. In
      the course of an hour the formless mass had assumed a well-defined outline
      against the soft blue sky. Then a lovely white bird came about the ship
      from the distance like a spirit from those Fortunate Islands. In a short
      time a gleam of sunshine was seen reflected from the flat surface of a
      cliff, and then the dark chasms upon the face of each of the island-rocks
      of the Dezertas could be seen. But when these were passed the long island
      of Madeira appeared gray and massive, and with a white cloud clinging
      about its highest ridges. Onward still, and the thin white thread of foam
      encircling the rocks was perceived. Then the outline of the cliffs stood
      defined against the fainter background of the island; but still all was
      gray and colourless. Not for long, however, for the sunlight smote the
      clouds and broke their gray masses, and then fell around the ridges,
      showing the green heights of vines and slopes of sugar-canes. But it was
      not until the roll of the waves against the cliff-faces was heard that the
      cloud-veil was lifted and all the glad green beauty of the slope flashed
      up to the blue sky, and thrilled all those who stood on the deck of the
      vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along this lovely coast the vessel moved through the sparkling green
      ripples. Not the faintest white fleck of cloud was now in the sky, and the
      sunlight falling downwards upon the island, brought out every brown rock
      of the coast in bold relief against the brilliant green of the slope. So
      close to the shore the vessel passed, the nearer cliffs appeared to glide
      away as the land in their shade was disclosed, and this effect of soft
      motion was entrancing to all who experienced it. Then the low headland
      with the island-rock crowned with a small pillared building was reached
      and passed, and the lovely bay of Funchal came in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen, who had lived among the sombre magnificence of the Irish scenery,
      felt this soft dazzling green as something marvellously strange and
      unexpected. Had not Mr. Glaston descended to his cabin at the earliest
      expression of delight that was forced from the lips of some young lady on
      the deck, he, would have been still more disappointed with Daireen, for
      her face was shining with happiness. But Mr. Harwood found more pleasure
      in watching her face than he did in gazing at the long crescent slope of
      the bay, and at the white houses that peeped from amongst the vines, or at
      the high convent of the hill. He did not speak a word to the girl, but
      only watched her as she drank in everything of beauty that passed before
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Loo rock at the farther point of the bay was neared, and as the
      engine slowed, the head of the steamer was brought round towards the white
      town of Funchal, spread all about the beach where the huge rollers were
      breaking. The tinkle of the engine-room telegraph brought a wonderful
      silence over everything as the propeller ceased. The voice of the captain
      giving orders about the lead line was heard distinctly, and the passengers
      felt inclined to speak in whispers. Suddenly with a harsh roar the great
      chain cable rushes out and the anchor drops into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the first stage of our voyage,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood. &ldquo;Now, while I
      select a boat, will you kindly get ready for landing? Oh, Mrs. Crawford,
      you will be with us at once, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without the loss of a moment,&rdquo; said the lady, going down to the cabins
      with Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various island authorities pushed off from the shore in their boats,
      sitting under canvas awnings and looking unpleasantly like banditti.
      Doctor Campion answered their kind inquiries regarding the health of the
      passengers, for nothing could exceed the attentive courtesy shown by the
      government in this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a young Scotchman, who had resolved to emulate Mr. Harwood's example
      in taking a party ashore, began making a bargain by signs with one of the
      boatmen, while his friends stood around. The major and the doctor having
      plotted together to go up to pay a visit to an hotel, pushed off in a
      government boat without acquainting any one with their movements. But long
      before the Scotchman had succeeded in reducing the prohibitory sum named
      by the man with whom he was treating for the transit of the party ashore,
      Mr. Harwood had a boat waiting at the rail for his friends, and Mrs.
      Butler and her daughter were in act to descend, chatting with the
      &ldquo;special&rdquo; who was to be their guide. Another party had already left for
      the shore, the young lady who had worn the blue and pink appearing in a
      bonnet surrounded with resplendent flowers and beads. But before the
      smiles of Mrs. Butler and Harwood had passed away, Mrs. Crawford and
      Daireen had come on deck again, the former with many apologies for her
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood ran down the sloping rail to assist the ladies into the boat
      that rose and fell with every throb of the waves against the ship's side.
      Mrs. Crawford followed him and was safely stowed in a place in the stern.
      Then came Mrs. Butler and her daughter, and while Mr. Harwood was handing
      them off the last step Daireen began to descend. But she had not got
      farther down than to where a young sailor was kneeling to shift the line
      of one of the fruit boats, when she stopped suddenly with a great start
      that almost forced a cry from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake go on&mdash;give no sign if you don't wish to make me
      wretched,&rdquo; said the sailor in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Miss Gerald, we are waiting,&rdquo; cried Harwood up the long rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen remained irresolute for a moment, then walked slowly down, and
      allowed herself to be handed into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you are not timid, Miss Gerald,&rdquo; said Harwood as the boat pushed
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timid?&rdquo; said Daireen mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your hand was really trembling as I helped you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I am not&mdash;not timid, only&mdash;I fear I shall not be very
      good company to-day; I feel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she looked back to the steamer
      and did not finish her sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood glanced at her for a moment, thinking if it really could be
      possible that she was regretting the absence of Mr. Glaston. Mrs. Crawford
      also looked at her and came to the conclusion that, at the last moment,
      the girl was recalling the aesthetic instructions of the young man who was
      doubtless sitting lonely in his cabin while she was bent on enjoying
      herself with a &ldquo;party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Daireen was only thinking how it was she had refrained from crying out
      when she saw the face of that sailor on the rail, and when she heard his
      voice; and it must be confessed that it was rather singular, taking into
      account the fact that she had recognised in the features and voice of that
      sailor the features and voice of Standish Macnamara.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE thin white silk
      thread of a moon was hanging in the blue twilight over the darkened
      western slope of the island, and almost within the horns of its crescent a
      planet was burning without the least tremulous motion. The lights of the
      town were glimmering over the waters, and the strange, wildly musical
      cries of the bullock-drivers were borne faintly out to the steamer,
      mingling with the sound of the bell of St. Mary's on the Mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel had just begun to move away from its anchorage, and Daireen
      Gerald was standing on the deck far astern leaning over the bulwarks
      looking back upon the island slope whose bright green had changed to
      twilight purple. Not of the enjoyment of the day she had spent up among
      the vines was the girl thinking; her memory fled back to the past days
      spent beneath the shadow of a slope that was always purple, with a robe of
      heather clinging to it from base to summit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don't regret having taken my advice about going on shore, Miss
      Gerald,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood, who had come beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it was all so lovely&mdash;so unlike what I ever saw
      or imagined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has always seemed lovely to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but to-day it was very
      lovely. I had got some pleasant recollections of the island before, but
      now the memories I shall retain will be the happiest of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was to-day really so much pleasanter?&rdquo; asked the girl quickly. &ldquo;Then I am
      indeed fortunate in my first visit. But you were not at any part of the
      island that you had not seen before,&rdquo; she added, after a moment's pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;But I saw all to-day under a new aspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had not visited it in September? Ah, I recollect now having heard
      that this was the best month for Madeira. You see I am fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are&mdash;fortunate,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;You are fortunate; you
      are a child; I am&mdash;a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen was quite puzzled by his tone; it was one of sadness, and she knew
      that he was not accustomed to be sad. He had not been so at any time
      through the day when they were up among the vineyards looking down upon
      the tiny ships in the harbour beneath them, or wandering through the
      gardens surrounding the villa at which they had lunched after being
      presented by their guide&mdash;no, he had certainly not displayed any sign
      of sadness then. But here he was now beside her watching the lights of the
      shore twinkling into dimness, and speaking in this way that puzzled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why, if you say you will have only pleasant recollections of
      to-day, you should speak in a tone like that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you would not understand it,&rdquo; he replied. If she had kept silence
      after he had spoken his previous sentence, he would have been tempted to
      say to her what he had on his heart, but her question made him hold back
      his words, for it proved to him what he told her&mdash;she would not
      understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable, however, that Mrs. Crawford, who by the merest accident,
      of course, chanced to come from the cabin at this moment, would have
      understood even the most enigmatical utterance that might pass from his
      lips on the subject of his future memories of the day they had spent on
      the island; she felt quite equal to the solution of any question of
      psychological analysis that might arise. But she contented herself now by
      calling Daireen's attention to the flashing of the phosphorescent water at
      the base of the cliffs round which the vessel was moving, and the
      observance of this phenomenon drew the girl's thoughts away from the
      possibility of discovering the meaning of the man's words. The major and
      his old comrade Doctor Campion then came near and expressed the greatest
      anxiety to learn how their friends had passed the day. Both major and
      doctor were in the happiest of moods. They had visited the hotel they
      agreed in stating, and no one on the deck undertook to prove anything to
      the contrary&mdash;no one, in fact, seemed to doubt in the least the truth
      of what they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time Mrs. Crawford and Daireen were left alone; not for long,
      however, for Mr. Glaston strolled languidly up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say I hope you enjoyed yourself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know very well you
      did not. I hope you could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen laughed. &ldquo;Your hopes are misplaced, I fear, Mr. Glaston,&rdquo; she
      answered. &ldquo;We had a very happy day&mdash;had we not, Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid we had, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Harwood said distinctly to me just now,&rdquo; continued Daireen,
      &ldquo;that it was the pleasantest day he had ever passed upon the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he said so? well, you see, he is a newspaper man, and they all look
      at things from a popular standpoint; whatever is popular is right, is
      their motto; while ours is, whatever is popular is wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself speaking as the representative of a class, no doubt, when
      he made use of the plural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Mr. Harwood seemed even more pleased than we were,&rdquo; continued the
      girl. &ldquo;He told me that the recollection of our exploration to-day would be
      the&mdash;the&mdash;yes, the happiest of his life. He did indeed,&rdquo; she
      added almost triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford, quickly interposing, &ldquo;he has got
      that way of talking. He has, no doubt, said those very words to every
      person he took ashore on his previous visits. He has, I know, said them
      every evening for a fortnight in the Mediterranean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't think he means anything beyond a stupid compliment to us?
      What a wretched thing it is to be a girl, after all. Never mind, I enjoyed
      myself beyond any doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible&mdash;quite impossible, child,&rdquo; said the young man.
      &ldquo;Enjoyment with a refined organisation such as yours can never be anything
      that is not reflective&mdash;it is something that cannot be shared with a
      number of persons. It is quite impossible that you could have any feeling
      in common with such a mind as this Mr. Harwood's or with the other people
      who went ashore. I heard nothing but expressions of enjoyment, and I felt
      really sad to think that there was not a refined soul among them all. They
      enjoyed themselves, therefore you did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can understand you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford at once, for she feared
      that Daireen might attempt to question the point he insisted on. Of course
      when the superior intellect of Mr. Glaston demonstrated that they could
      not have enjoyed themselves, it was evident that it was their own
      sensations which were deceiving them. Mrs. Crawford trusted to the
      decision of the young man's intellect more implicitly than she did her own
      senses: just as Christopher Sly, old Sly's son of Burton Heath, came to
      believe the practical jesters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you enjoy the society and scenery of a desert island better than
      an inhabited one?&rdquo; asked the girl, somewhat rebellious at the concessions
      of Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly, if everything was in good taste,&rdquo; he answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, if everything was in accordance with your own taste,&rdquo; came the
      voice of Mr. Harwood, who, unseen, had rejoined the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Glaston made no reply. He had previously become aware of the
      unsatisfactory results of making any answers to such men as wrote for
      newspapers. As he had always considered such men outside the world of art
      in which he lived and to the inhabitants of which he addressed himself, it
      was hardly to be expected that he would put himself on a level of argument
      with them. In fact, Mr. Glaston rarely consented to hold an argument with
      any one. If people maintained opinions different from his own, it was so
      much the worse for those people&mdash;that was all he felt. It was to a
      certain circle of young women in good society that he preferred addressing
      himself, for he knew that to each individual in that circle he appeared as
      the prophet and high priest of art. His tone-poems in the college
      magazine, his impromptus&mdash;musical <i>aquarellen</i> he called them&mdash;performed
      in secret and out of hearing of any earthly audience, his
      colour-harmonies, his statuesque idealisms&mdash;all these were his
      priestly ministrations; while the interpretation, not of his own works&mdash;this
      he never attempted&mdash;but of the works of three poets belonging to what
      he called his school, of one painter, and of one musical composer, was his
      prophetical service.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obviously impossible that such a man could put himself on that
      mental level which would be implied by his action should he consent to
      make any answer to a person like Mr. Harwood. But apart from these general
      grounds, Mr. Glaston had got concrete reasons for declining to discuss any
      subject with this newspaper man. He knew that it was Mr. Harwood who had
      called the tone-poems of the college magazine alliterative conundrums for
      young ladies; that it was Mr. Harwood who had termed one of the
      colour-harmonies a study in virulent jaundice; that it was Mr. Harwood who
      had, after smiling on being told of the <i>aquarellen</i> impromptus,
      expressed a desire to hear one of these compositions&mdash;all this Mr.
      Glaston knew well, and so when Mr. Harwood made that remark about taste
      Mr. Glaston did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen, however, did not feel the silence oppressive. She kept her eyes
      fixed upon that thin thread of moon that was now almost touching the dark
      ridge of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harwood looked at her for a few moments, and then he too leaned over the
      side of the ship and gazed at that lovely moon and its burning star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How curious,&rdquo; he said gently&mdash;&ldquo;how very curious, is it not, that the
      sight of that hill and that moon should bring back to me memories of Lough
      Suangorm and Slieve Docas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave a start. &ldquo;You are thinking of them too? I am so glad. It
      makes me so happy to know that I am not the only one here who knows all
      about Suangorm.&rdquo; Suddenly another thought seemed to come to her. She
      turned her eyes away from the island and glanced down the deck anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood very gently indeed; &ldquo;you are not alone in your
      memories of the loveliest spot of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford thought it well to interpose. &ldquo;My dear Daireen, you must be
      careful not to take a chill now after all the unusual exercise you have
      had during the day. Don't you think you had better go below?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had much better,&rdquo; said the girl quickly and in a startled tone;
      and she had actually gone to the door of the companion before she
      recollected that she had not said good-night either to Glaston or Harwood.
      She turned back and redeemed her negligence, and then went down with her
      good guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; thought Mr. Glaston, &ldquo;she fears that I am hurt by her
      disregard of my advice about going ashore with those people. Poor child!
      perhaps I was hard upon her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little thing,&rdquo; thought Mr. Harwood. &ldquo;She begins to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would never do to let that sort or thing go on,&rdquo; thought Mrs.
      Crawford, as she saw that Daireen got a cup of tea before retiring. Mrs.
      Crawford fully appreciated Mr. Harwood's cleverness in reading the girl's
      thought and so quickly adapting his speech to the requirements of the
      moment; but she felt her own superiority of cleverness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the three was a careful and experienced observer, but there are
      certain conditional influences to be taken into account in arriving at a
      correct conclusion as to the motives of speech or action of every human
      subject under observation; and the reason that these careful analysts of
      motives were so utterly astray in tracing to its source the remissness of
      Miss Gerald, was probably because none of the three was aware of the
      existence of an important factor necessary for the solution of the
      interesting problem they had worked out so airily; this factor being the
      sudden appearance of Standish Macnamara beside the girl in the morning,
      and her consequent reflections upon the circumstance in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she sat alone in her cabin, seeing through the port the effect of
      the silver moonlight upon the ridge of the hill behind which the moon
      itself had now sunk, she was wondering, as she had often wondered during
      the day, if indeed it was Standish whom she had seen and whose voice she
      had heard. All had been so sudden&mdash;so impossible, she thought, that
      the sight of him and the hearing of his voice seemed to her but as the
      memories of a dream of her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now that she was alone and capable of reflecting upon the matter, she
      felt that she had not been deceived. By some means the young man to whom
      she had written her last letter in Ireland was aboard the steamer. It was
      very wonderful to the girl to reflect upon this; but then she thought if
      he was aboard, why should she not be able to find him and ask him all
      about himself?

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE question which
      suggested itself to Daireen as to the possibility of seeing Standish
      aboard the steamer, was not the only one that occupied her thoughts. How
      had he come aboard, and why had he come aboard, were further questions
      whose solution puzzled her. She recollected how he had told her on that
      last day she had seen him, while they walked in the garden after leaving
      The Macnamara in that side room with the excellent specimen of ancient
      furniture ranged with glass vessels, that he was heartily tired of living
      among the ruins of the castle, and that he had made up his mind to go out
      into the world of work. She had then begged of him to take no action of so
      much importance until her father should have returned to give him the
      advice he needed; and in that brief postscript which she had added to the
      farewell letter given into the care of the bard O'Brian, she had expressed
      her regret that this counsel of hers had been rendered impracticable. Was
      it possible, however, that Standish placed so much confidence in the
      likelihood of valuable advice being given to him by her father that he had
      resolved to go out to the Cape and speak with him on the subject face to
      face, she thought; but it struck her that there would be something like an
      inconsistency in the young man's travelling six thousand miles to take an
      opinion as to the propriety of his leaving his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was she to do? She felt that she must see Standish and have from his
      own lips an explanation of how he had come aboard the ship; but in that,
      sentence he had spoken to her he had entreated of her to keep silence, so
      that she dared not seek for him under the guidance of Mrs. Crawford or any
      of her friends aboard the vessel. It would be necessary for her to find
      him alone, and she knew that this would be a difficult thing to do,
      situated as she was. But let the worst come, she reflected that it could
      only result in the true position of Standish being-known. This was really
      all that the girl believed could possibly be the result if a secret
      interview between herself and a sailor aboard the steamer should be
      discovered; and, thinking of the worst consequences so lightly, made her
      all the more anxious to hasten on such an interview if she could contrive
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself upon her little sofa and tried to think by what means
      she could meet with Standish, and yet fulfil his entreaty for secrecy. Her
      imagination, so far as inventing plans was concerned, did not seem to be
      inexhaustible. After half an hour's pondering over the matter, no more
      subtle device was suggested to her than going on deck and walking alone
      towards the fore-part of the ship between the deck-house and the bulwarks,
      where it might possibly chance that Standish would be found. This was her
      plan, and she did not presume to think to herself that its intricacy was
      the chief element of its possible success. Had she been aware of the fact
      that Standish was at that instant standing in the shadow of that
      deck-house looking anxiously astern in the hope of catching a glimpse of
      her&mdash;had she known that since the steamer had left the English port
      he had every evening stood with the same object in the same place, she
      would have been more hopeful of her simple plan succeeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate she stole out of her cabin and went up the companion and out
      upon the deck, with all the caution that a novice in the art of
      dissembling could bring to her aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was full of softness&mdash;softness of gray reflected light from
      the waters that were rippling along before the vessel&mdash;softness of
      air that seemed saturated with the balm of odorous trees growing upon the
      slopes of those Fortunate Islands. The deck was deserted by passengers;
      only Major Crawford, the doctor, and the special correspondent were
      sitting in a group in their cane chairs, smoking their cheroots and
      discussing some action of a certain colonel that had not yet been fully
      explained, though it had taken place fifteen years previously. The group
      could not see her, she knew; but even if they had espied her and demanded
      an explanation, she felt that she had progressed sufficiently far in the
      crooked ways of deception to be able to lull their suspicions by her
      answers. She could tell them that she had a headache, or put them off with
      some equally artful excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked gently along until she was at the rear of the deck-house where
      the stock of the mainmast was standing with all its gear. She looked down
      the dark tunnel passage between the side of the house and the bulwarks,
      but she felt her courage fail her: she dared do all that might become a
      woman, but the gloom of that covered place, and the consciousness that
      beyond it lay the mysterious fore-cabin space, caused her to pause. What
      was she to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there came the sound of a low voice at her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen, Daireen, why did you come here?&rdquo; She started and looked around
      trembling, for it was the voice of Standish, though she could not see the
      form of the speaker. It was some moments before she found that he was
      under the broad rail leading to the ship's bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is you, Standish, indeed?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How on earth did you come
      aboard?&mdash;Why have you come?&mdash;Are you really a sailor?&mdash;Where
      is your father?&mdash;Does he know?&mdash;Why don't you shake hands with
      me, Standish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These few questions she put to him in a breath, looking between the steps
      of the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen, hush, for Heaven's sake!&rdquo; he said anxiously. &ldquo;You don't know
      what you are doing in coming to speak with me here&mdash;I am only a
      sailor, and if you were seen near me it would be terrible. Do go back to
      your cabin and leave me to my wretchedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not go back,&rdquo; she said resolutely. &ldquo;I am your friend, Standish,
      and why should I not speak to you for an hour if I wish? You are not the
      quartermaster at the wheel. What a start you gave me this morning! Why did
      you not tell me you were coming in this steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not leave Suangorm until the next morning after I heard you had
      gone,&rdquo; he answered in a whisper. &ldquo;I should have died&mdash;I should
      indeed, Daireen, if I had remained at home while you were gone away
      without any one to take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Standish, Standish, what will your father say?&mdash;What will he
      think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; said Standish. &ldquo;I told him on that day when we returned
      from Suanmara that I would go away. I was a fool that I did not make up my
      mind long ago. It was, indeed, only when you left that I carried out my
      resolution. I learned what ship you were going in; I had as much money as
      brought me to England&mdash;I had heard of people working their passage
      abroad; so I found out the captain of the steamer, and telling him all
      about myself that I could&mdash;not of course breathing your name, Daireen&mdash;I
      begged him to allow me to work my way as a sailor, and he agreed to give
      me the passage. He wanted me to become a waiter in the cabin, but I
      couldn't do that; I didn't mind facing all the hardships that might come,
      so long as I was near you&mdash;and&mdash;able to get your father's
      advice. Now do go back, Daireen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one will see us,&rdquo; said the girl, after a pause, in which she reflected
      on the story he had told her. &ldquo;But all is so strange, Standish,&rdquo; she
      continued&mdash;&ldquo;all is so unlike anything I ever imagined possible. Oh,
      Standish, it is too dreadful to think of your being a sailor&mdash;just a
      sailor&mdash;aboard the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing so very bad in it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I can work, thank God;
      and I mean to work. The thought of being near you&mdash;that is, near the
      time when I can get the advice I want from your father&mdash;makes all my
      labour seem light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I ask the captain, he will, I am sure, let you become a
      passenger,&rdquo; said the girl suddenly. &ldquo;Do let me ask him, Standish. It is so&mdash;so
      hard for you to have to work as a sailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no harder than I expected it would be,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am not afraid
      to work hard: and I feel that I am doing something&mdash;I feel it. I
      should be more wretched in the cabin. Now do not think of speaking to me
      for the rest of the voyage, Daireen; only, do not forget that you have a
      friend aboard the ship&mdash;a friend who will be willing to die for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was very tremulous, and she could see his tearful eyes
      glistening in the gray light as he put out one of his hands to her. She
      put her own hand into it and felt his strong earnest grasp as he
      whispered, &ldquo;God bless you, Daireen! God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it six bells, quartermaster,&rdquo; came the voice of the officer on watch
      from the bridge. In fear and trembling Daireen waited until the man came
      aft and gave the six strokes upon the ship's bell that hung quite near
      where she was standing&mdash;Standish thinking it prudent to remain close
      in the shade of the rail. The quartermaster saw her, but did not, of
      course, conceive it to be within the range of his duties to give any
      thought to the circumstance of a passenger being on deck at that hour.
      When the girl turned round after the bell had been struck, she found that
      Standish had disappeared. All she could do was to hasten back to her cabin
      with as much caution as it was possible for her to preserve, for she could
      still hear the hoarse tones of the major's voice coming from the centre of
      the group far astern, who were regaled with a very pointed chronicle of a
      certain station in the empire of Hindustan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen reached her cabin and sat once more upon her sofa, breathing a
      sigh of relief, for she had never in her life had such a call upon her
      courage as this to which she had just responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was flushed and hot, and her hands were trembling, so she threw
      open the pane of the cabin port-hole and let the soft breeze enter. It
      moved about her hair as she stood there, and she seemed to feel the
      fingers of a dear friend caressing her forehead. Then she sat down once
      more and thought over all that had happened since the morning when she had
      gone on deck to see that gray cloud-land brighten into the lovely green
      slope of Madeira.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of all that Standish had told her about himself, and she felt
      her heart overflowing, as were her eyes, with sympathy for him who had
      cast aside his old life and was endeavouring to enter upon the new.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat there in her dreaming mood all the days of the past came back
      to her, with a clearness she had never before known. All the pleasant
      hours returned to her with even a more intense happiness than she had felt
      at first. For out of the distance of these Fortunate Islands the ghosts of
      the blessed departed hours came and moved before her, looking into her
      face with their own sweet pale faces; thus she passed from a waking dream
      into a dream of sleep as she lay upon her sofa, and the ghost shapes
      continued to float before her. The fatigue of the day, the darkness of the
      cabin, and the monotonous washing of the ripples against the side of the
      ship, had brought on her sleep before she had got into her berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden start she awoke and sprang to her feet in instantaneous
      consciousness, for the monotony of the washing waves was broken by a sound
      that was strange and startling to her ears&mdash;the sound of something
      hard tapping at irregular intervals upon the side of the ship just at her
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran over to the cabin port and looked out fearfully&mdash;looked out
      and gave a cry of terror, for beneath her&mdash;out from those gray waters
      there glanced up to her in speechless agony the white face of a man; she
      saw it but for a moment, then it seemed to be swept away from her and
      swallowed up in the darkness of the deep waters.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> SINGLE cry of
      terror was all that Daireen uttered as she fell back upon her berth. An
      instant more and she was standing with white lips, and hands that were
      untrembling as the rigid hand of a dead person. She knew what was to be
      done as plainly as if she saw everything in a picture. She rushed into the
      saloon and mounted the companion to the deck. There sat the little group
      astern just as she had seen them an hour before, only that the doctor had
      fallen asleep under the influence of one of the less pointed of the
      major's stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; cried the major, as the girl clutched the back of his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, Miss Gerald, what is the matter?&rdquo; said Harwood, leaping to
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the white wake of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;there,&rdquo; she whispered&mdash;&ldquo;a man&mdash;drowning&mdash;clinging
      to something&mdash;a wreck&mdash;I saw him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! dear me!&rdquo; said the major, in a tone of relief, and with a breath
      of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the special correspondent had looked into the girl's face. It was his
      business to understand the difference between dreaming and waking. He was
      by the side of the officer on watch in a moment. A few words were enough
      to startle the officer into acquiescence with the demands of the
      &ldquo;special.&rdquo; The unwonted sound of the engine-room telegraph was heard, its
      tinkle shaking the slumbers of the chief engineer as effectively as if it
      had been the thunder of an alarum peal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stopping of the engine, the blowing off of the steam, and the arrival
      of the captain upon the deck, were simultaneous occurrences. The officer's
      reply to his chief as he hurried aft did not seem to be very satisfactory,
      judging from the manner in which it was received.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Harwood had left the officer to explain the stoppage of the vessel,
      and was now kneeling by the side of the chair, back upon which lay the
      unconscious form of Daireen, while the doctor was forcing some brandy&mdash;all
      that remained in the major's tumbler&mdash;between her lips, and a young
      sailor&mdash;the one who had been at the rail in the morning&mdash;chafed
      her pallid hand. The major was scanning the expanse of water by aid of his
      pilot glass, and the quartermaster who had been steering went to the line
      of the patent log to haul it in&mdash;his first duty at any time on the
      stopping of the vessel, to prevent the line&mdash;the strain being taken
      off it&mdash;fouling with the propeller.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the steamer is under weigh it is the work of two sailors to take in
      the eighty fathoms of log-line, otherwise, however, the line is of course
      quite slack; it was thus rather inexplicable to the quartermaster to find
      much more resistance to his first haul than if the vessel were going full
      speed ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The darned thing's fouled already,&rdquo; he murmured for his own satisfaction.
      He could not take in a fathom, so great was the resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it all, major,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;isn't this too bad? Bringing the
      ship to like this, and&mdash;ah, here they come! All the ship's company
      will be aft in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum, my boy, very rum,&rdquo; muttered the sympathetic major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, captain?&rdquo; said one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any danger?&rdquo; asked a tremulous second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's a collision or a leak, don't keep it from us, sir,&rdquo; came a stern
      contralto. For in various stages of toilet incompleteness the passengers
      were crowding out of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the &ldquo;unhappy master&rdquo; could utter a word of reply, the sailor
      had touched his cap and reported to the third mate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Log-line fouled on wreck, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad!&rdquo; shouted the major, who was twisting the log-line about, and
      peering into the water. &ldquo;By gad, the girl was right! The line has fouled
      on some wreck, and there is a body made fast to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain gave just a single glance in the direction indicated. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by gig davits and lower away,&rdquo; he shouted to the watch, who had of
      course come aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men ran to where the boat was hanging, and loosened the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Heaven preserve us! they are taking to the boats!&rdquo; cried a female
      passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool, my good woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford tartly. The major's
      wife had come on deck in a most marvellous costume, and she was already
      holding a sal-volatile bottle to Daireen's nose, having made a number of
      inquiries of Mr. Harwood and the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the other passengers had crowded to the ship's side, and were watching
      the men in the boat cutting at something which had been reached at the end
      of the log-line. They could see the broken stump of a mast and the
      cross-trees, but nothing further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have got it into the boat,&rdquo; said the major, giving the result of his
      observation through the binocular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, ladies, go below!&rdquo; cried the captain. But no one
      moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't want to see the ghastly corpse of a drowned man gnawed by
      fishes for weeks maybe, you had better go down, ladies,&rdquo; said the chief
      officer. Still no one stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major, who was an observer of nature, smiled and winked sagaciously at
      the exasperated captain before he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should the ladies go down at all? it's a pleasant night, and begad,
      sir, a group of nightcaps like this isn't to be got together more than
      once in a lifetime.&rdquo; Before the gallant officer had finished his sentence
      the deck was cleared of women; but, of course, the luxury of seeing a dead
      body lifted from the boat being too great to be missed, the starboard
      cabin ports had many faces opposite them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor left Daireen to the care of Mrs. Crawford, saying that she
      would recover consciousness in a few minutes, and he hastened with a
      kaross to the top of the boiler, where he had shouted to the men in the
      boat to carry the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The companion-rail having been lowered, it was an easy matter for the four
      men to take the body on deck and to lay it upon the tiger-skin before the
      doctor, who rubbed his hands&mdash;an expression which the seamen
      interpreted as meaning satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, my men, raise his head&mdash;so&mdash;throw the light on his
      face. By George, he doesn't seem to have suffered from the oysters;
      there's hope for him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the compassionate surgeon began cutting the clothing from the limbs of
      the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't take the pieces away,&rdquo; he said to one of the men; &ldquo;let them
      remain here Now dry his arms carefully, and we'll try and get some air
      into his lungs, if they're not already past work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before the doctor had commenced his operations the ship's gig had been
      hauled up once more to the davits, and the steamer was going ahead at slow
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep her at slow until the dawn,&rdquo; said the captain to the officer on
      watch. &ldquo;And let there be a good lookout; there may be others floating upon
      the wreck. Call me if the doctor brings the body to life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain did not think it necessary to view the body that had been
      snatched from the deep. The captain was a compassionate man and full of
      tender feeling; he was exceedingly glad that he had had it in his power to
      pick up that body, even with the small probability there was of being able
      to restore life to its frozen blood; but he would have been much more
      grateful to Providence had it been so willed that it should have been
      picked up without the necessity of stopping the engines of the steamer for
      nearly a quarter of an hour. It was explained to him that Miss Gerald had
      been the first to see the face of the man upon the wreck, but he could
      scarcely understand how it was possible for her to have seen it from her
      cabin. He was also puzzled to know how it was that the log-line had not
      been carried away so soon as it was entangled in such a large mass of
      wreck when the steamer was going at full speed. He, however, thought it as
      well to resume his broken slumbers without waiting to solve either of
      these puzzling questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the chief officer who was now on watch, when the deck was once more
      deserted&mdash;Daireen having been taken down to her cabin&mdash;made the
      attempt to account for both of these occurrences. He found that the girl's
      cabin was not far astern of the companion-rail that had been lowered
      during the day, and he saw that, in the confusion of weighing anchor in
      the dimness, a large block with its gear which was used in the hauling of
      the vegetable baskets aboard, had been allowed to hang down the side of
      the ship between the steps of the rail; and upon the hook of the block,
      almost touching the water, he found some broken cordage. He knew then that
      the hook had caught fast in the cordage of the wreck as the steamer went
      past, and the wreck had swung round until it was just opposite the girl's
      cabin, when the cordage had given way; not, however, until some of the
      motion of the ship had been communicated to the wreck so that there was no
      abrupt strain put on the log-line when it had become entangled. It was all
      plain to the chief officer, as no doubt it would have been to the captain
      had he waited to search out the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So soon as the body had been brought aboard the ship all the interest of
      the passengers seemed to subside, and the doctor was allowed to pursue his
      experiments of resuscitation without inquiry. The chief officer being
      engaged at his own business of working out the question of the endurance
      of the log-line, and keeping a careful lookout for any other portions of
      wreck, had almost forgotten that the doctor and two of the sailors were
      applying a series of restoratives to the body of the man who had been
      detached from the wreck. It was nearly two hours after he had come on
      watch that one of the sailors&mdash;the one who had been kneeling by the
      side of Daireen&mdash;came up to the chief officer presenting Doctor
      Campion's compliments, with the information that the man was breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with the captain's instructions, the chief officer knocked
      at the cabin door and repeated the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breathing is he?&rdquo; said the captain rather sleepily. &ldquo;Very good, Mr.
      Holden; I'm glad to hear it. Just call me again in case he should
      relapse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain had hitherto, in alluding to the man, made use of the neuter
      pronoun, but now that breath was restored he acknowledged his right to a
      gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; replied the officer, closing the door.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was the general
      opinion in the cabin that Miss Gerald&mdash;the young lady who was in such
      an exclusive set&mdash;had shown very doubtful taste in being the first to
      discover the man upon the wreck. Every one had, of course, heard the
      particulars of the matter from the steward's assistants, who had in turn
      been in communication with the watch on deck. At any rate, it was felt by
      the ladies that it showed exceedingly bad taste in Miss Gerald to take
      such steps as eventually led to the ladies appearing on deck in incomplete
      toilettes. There was, indeed, a very pronounced feeling against Miss
      Gerald; several representatives of the other sections of the cabin society
      declaring that they could not conscientiously admit Miss Gerald into their
      intimacy. That dreadful designing old woman, the major's wife, might do as
      she pleased, they declared, and so might Mrs. Butler and her daughter, who
      were only the near relatives of some Colonial Governor, but such
      precedents should be by no means followed, the ladies of this section
      announced to each other. But as Daireen had never hitherto found it
      necessary to fall back upon any of the passengers outside her own set, the
      resolution of the others, even if it had come to her ears, would not have
      caused her any great despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain made some inquiries of the doctor in the morning, and learned
      that the rescued man was breathing, though still unconscious. Mr. Harwood
      showed even a greater anxiety to hear from Mrs. Crawford about Daireen,
      after the terrible night she had gone through, and he felt no doubt
      proportionately happy when he was told that she was now sleeping, having
      passed some hours in feverish excitement. Daireen had described to Mrs.
      Crawford how she had seen the face looking up to her from the water, and
      Mr. Harwood, hearing this, and making a careful examination of the outside
      of the ship in the neighbourhood of Daireen's cabin, came to the same
      conclusion as that at which the chief officer had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford tried to make Mr. Glaston equally interested in her
      protégée, but she was scarcely successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How brave it was in the dear child, was it not, Mr. Glaston?&rdquo; she asked.
      &ldquo;Just imagine her glancing casually out of the port&mdash;thinking, it
      maybe, of her father, who is perhaps dying at the Cape&rdquo;&mdash;the good
      lady felt that this bit of poetical pathos might work wonders with Mr.
      Glaston&mdash;&ldquo;and then,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;fancy her seeing that terrible,
      ghastly thing in the water beneath her! What must her feelings have been
      as she rushed on deck and gave the alarm that caused that poor wretch to
      be saved! Wonderful, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Glaston's face was quite devoid of expression on hearing this
      powerful narrative. The introduction of the pathos even did not make him
      wince; and there was a considerable pause before he said the few words
      that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Poor child. It was very melodramatic&mdash;terribly
      melodramatic; but she is still young, her taste is&mdash;ah&mdash;plastic.
      At least I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford began to feel that, after all, it was something to have
      gained this expression of hope from Mr. Glaston, though her warmth of
      feeling did undoubtedly receive a chill from his manner. She did not
      reflect that there is a certain etiquette to be observed in the saving of
      the bodies as well as the souls of people, and that the aesthetic element,
      in the opinion of some people, should enter largely into every scheme of
      salvation, corporeal as well as spiritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was sitting with Major Crawford when the lady joined them a few
      minutes after her conversation with Mr. Glaston, and never had Mrs.
      Crawford fancied that her husband's old friend could talk in such an
      affectionate way as he now did about the rescued man. She could almost
      bring herself to believe that she saw the tears of emotion in his eyes as
      he detailed the circumstances of the man's resuscitation. The doctor felt
      personally obliged to him for his handsome behaviour in bearing such
      testimony to the skill of his resuscitator.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lady spoke of the possibilities of a relapse, the doctor's eyes
      glistened at first, but under the influence of maturer thought, he sighed
      and shook his head. No, he knew that there are limits to the generosity of
      even a half-strangled man&mdash;a relapse was too much to hope for; but
      the doctor felt at that instant that if this &ldquo;case&rdquo; should see its way to
      a relapse, and subsequently to submit to be restored, it would place
      itself under a lasting obligation to its physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely, thought Mrs. Crawford, when the doctor talks of the stranger with
      such enthusiasm he will go into raptures about Daireen; so she quietly
      alluded to the girl's achievement. But the doctor could see no reason for
      becoming ecstatic about Miss Gerald. Five minutes with the smelling-bottle
      had restored her to consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a trifle&mdash;overstrung nerves, you know,&rdquo; he said, as he lit
      another cheroot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think of her bravery in keeping strong until she had told you all
      that she had seen!&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;I never heard of anything so brave!
      Just fancy her looking out of the port&mdash;thinking of her father
      perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;the lady went on to the end of that pathetic sentence of
      hers, but it had no effect upon the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, very true!&rdquo; he muttered, looking at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the major was secretly convulsed for some moments after his wife had
      spoken her choice piece of pathos, and though he did not betray himself,
      she knew well all that was in his mind, and so turned away without a
      further word. So soon as she was out of hearing, the major exchanged
      confidential chuckles with his old comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not what you'd call a handsome man as he lies at present, Campion,&rdquo;
       remarked Mr. Harwood, strolling up later in the day. &ldquo;But you did well not
      to send him to the forecastle, I think; he has not been a sailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, my boy,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;He is not a handsome man, you say,
      and I agree with you that he is not seen to advantage just now; but I made
      up my mind an hour after I saw him that he was not for the forecastle, or
      even the forecabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you are right,&rdquo; said Harwood. &ldquo;Yes; there is a something in
      his look that half drowning could not kill. That was the sort of thing you
      felt, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like it,&rdquo; said the mild physician. &ldquo;It was this,&rdquo; he took out of
      his pocket an envelope, from which he extracted a document that he handed
      to Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an order for four hundred pounds, payable by a certain bank in
      England, and granted by the Sydney branch of the Australasian Banking
      Company to one Mr. Oswin Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see; he is a gentleman,&rdquo; said Harwood, returning the order. It had
      evidently suffered a sea-change, but it had been carefully dried by the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is a gentleman,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;That is what I remarked when I
      found this in a flask in one of his pockets. Sharp thing to do, to keep a
      paper free from damp and yet to have it in a buoyant case. Devilish sharp
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the man's name is this&mdash;Oswin Markham?&rdquo; said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt about it,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever; unless he stole the order from the rightful owner, and
      meant to get it cashed at his leisure,&rdquo; remarked Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must have stolen the shirt, the collar, and the socks of Oswin
      Markham,&rdquo; snarled the doctor. &ldquo;All these things of his are marked as plain
      as red silk can do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any man who would steal an order for four hundred pounds would not
      hesitate about a few toilet necessaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you'll suggest to the skipper the need to put him in irons as soon
      as he is sufficiently recovered to be conscious of an insult,&rdquo; cried the
      doctor in an acrid way that received a sympathetic chuckle from the major.
      &ldquo;Young man, you've got your brain too full of fancies&mdash;a devilish
      deal, sir; they do well enough retailed for the readers of the <i>Dominant
      Trumpeter</i>, but sensible people don't want to hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't force them upon you and Crawford, my dear Campion,&rdquo; said
      Harwood, walking away, for he knew that upon some occasions the doctor
      should be conciliated, and in the matter of a patient every allowance
      should be made for his warmth of feeling. So long as one of his &ldquo;cases&rdquo;
       paid his skill the compliment of surviving any danger, he spoke well of
      the patient; but when one behaved so unhandsomely as to die, it was with
      the doctor <i>De mortuis nil nisi malum</i>. Harwood knew this, and so he
      walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that he found himself&mdash;or rather made himself&mdash;alone, he
      thought over all the events of the previous eventful day; but somehow
      there did not seem to be any event worth remembering that was not
      associated with Daireen Gerald. He recollected how he had watched her when
      they had been together among the lovely gardens of the island slope. As
      she turned her eyes seaward with an earnest, sad, <i>questioning</i> gaze,
      he felt that he had never seen a picture so full of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words he had spoken to her, telling her that the day he had spent on
      the island was the happiest of his life, were true indeed; he had never
      felt so happy; and now as he reflected upon his after-words his conscience
      smote him for having pretended to her that he was thinking of the place
      where he knew her thoughts had carried her: he had seen from her face that
      she was dreaming about her Irish home, and he had made her feel that the
      recollection of the lough and the mountains was upon his mind also. He
      felt now how coarse had been his deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then recalled the final scene of the night, when, as he was trying to
      pursue his own course of thought, and at the same time pretend to be
      listening to the major's thrice-told tale of a certain colonel's conduct
      at the Arradambad station, the girl had appeared before them like a
      vision. Yes, it was altogether a remarkable day even for a special
      correspondent. The reflection upon its events made him very thoughtful
      during the entire of this afternoon. Nor was he at all disturbed by the
      information Doctor Campion brought vo him just when he was going for his
      usual smoke upon the bridge, while the shore of Palma was yet in view not
      far astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good fellow he is,&rdquo; murmured the doctor. &ldquo;Capital fellow! opened his eyes
      just now when I was in his cabin&mdash;recovered consciousness in a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, in a moment?&rdquo; said Harwood dubiously. &ldquo;I thought it always needed the
      existence of some link of consciousness between the past and the present
      to bring about a restoration like this&mdash;some familiar sight&mdash;some
      well-known sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, by George, you are right, my boy, this time, though you are a
      'special,'&rdquo; said the doctor, grinning. &ldquo;Yes, I was standing by the
      fellow's bunk when I heard Crawford call for another bottle of soda.
      Robinson got it for him, and bang went the cork, of course; a faint smile
      stole over the haggard features, my boy, the glassy eyes opened full of
      intelligence and with a mine of pleasant recollections. That familiar
      sound of the popping of the cork acted as the link you talk of. He saw all
      in a moment, and tried to put out his hand to me. 'My boy,' I said,
      'you've behaved most handsomely, and I'll get you a glass of brandy out of
      another bottle, but don't you try to speak for another day.' And I got him
      a glass from Crawford, though, by George, sir, Crawford grudged it; he
      didn't see the sentiment of the thing, sir, and when I tried to explain
      it, he said I was welcome to the cork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital tale for an advertisement of the brandy,&rdquo; said Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the doctor with many smiles hastened to spread abroad the story of
      the considerate behaviour of his patient, and Harwood was left to continue
      his twilight meditations alone once more. He was sitting in his deck-chair
      on the ship's bridge, and he could but dimly hear the laughter and the
      chat of the passengers far astern. He did not remain for long in this
      dreamy mood of his, for Mrs. Crawford and Daireen Gerald were seen coming
      up the rail, and he hastened to meet them. The girl was very pale but
      smiling, and in the soft twilight she seemed very lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad to see you,&rdquo; he said, as he settled a chair for her. &ldquo;I
      feared a great many things when you did not appear to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not talk too much,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, who had not expected to
      find Mr. Harwood alone in this place. &ldquo;I brought Miss Gerard up here in
      order that she might not be subjected to the gaze of those colonists on
      the deck; a little quiet is what she needs to restore her completely from
      her shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very foolish, I am afraid you think&mdash;very foolish of me to
      behave as I did,&rdquo; said Daireen, with a faint little smile. &ldquo;But I had been
      asleep in my cabin, and I&mdash;I was not so strong as I should have been.
      The next time I hope I shall not be so very stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Gerald,&rdquo; said Harwood, &ldquo;you behaved as a heroine. There is
      no woman aboard the ship&mdash;Mrs. Crawford of course excepted&mdash;who
      would have had courage to do what you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he,&rdquo; said the girl somewhat eagerly&mdash;&ldquo;he&mdash;is he really
      safe?&mdash;has he recovered? Tell me all, Mr. Harwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford, interposing. &ldquo;You must not speak a word
      about him. Do you want to be thrown into a fresh state of excitement, my
      dear, now that you are getting on so nicely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am more excited remaining as I am in doubt about that poor man. Was
      he a sailor, Mr. Harwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears-not,&rdquo; said Harwood. &ldquo;The doctor, however, is returning; he
      will tell all that is safe to be told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really must protest,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;Well, I will be a good girl
      and not ask for any information whatever,&rdquo; said Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was not destined to remain in complete ignorance on the subject
      which might reasonably be expected to interest her, for the doctor on
      seeing her hastened up, and, of course, Mrs. Crawford's protest was weak
      against his judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he cried, shaking Daireen warmly by the hand. &ldquo;You
      are anxious to know the sequel of the romance of last night, I am sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Doctor Campion,&rdquo; said Daireen almost mischievously; &ldquo;Mrs.
      Crawford says I must hear nothing, and think about nothing, all this
      evening. Did you not say so, Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, Doctor Campion is supposed to know much better than myself
      how you should be treated in your present nervous condition. If he chooses
      to talk to you for an hour or two hours about drowning wretches, he may do
      so on his own responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drowning wretches!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;My dear madam, you have not been
      told all, or you would not talk in this way. He is no drowning wretch, but
      a gentleman; look at this&mdash;ah, I forgot it's not light enough for you
      to see the document, but Harwood there will tell you all that it
      contains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does that wonderful document contain, Mr. Harwood?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Crawford. &ldquo;Tell us, please, and we shall drop the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That document,&rdquo; said Harwood, with affected solemnity; &ldquo;it is a guarantee
      of the respectability of the possessor; it is a bank order for four
      hundred pounds, payable to one Oswin Markham, and it was, I understand,
      found upon the person of the man who has just been resuscitated through
      the skill of our good friend Doctor Campion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you will not call him a poor wretch, I am sure,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;He
      has now fully recovered consciousness, and, you see, he is a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that, no doubt, Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; said Harwood, in a tone that made
      the good physician long to have him for a few weeks on the sick list&mdash;the
      way the doctor had of paying off old scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be sarcastic, Mr. Harwood,&rdquo; said Daireen. Then she added, &ldquo;What did
      you say the name was?&mdash;Oswin Markham? I like it&mdash;I like it very
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;Here is Mr. Glaston.&rdquo; And it was indeed Mr.
      Glaston who ascended the rail with a languor of motion in keeping with the
      hour of twilight. With a few muttered words the doctor walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston, after he had shaken hands with Daireen&mdash;&ldquo;I
      hear that there was some wreck or other picked up last night with a man
      clinging to it&mdash;a dreadfully vulgar fellow he must be to carry about
      with him a lot of money&mdash;a man with a name like what one would find
      attached to the hero of an East End melodrama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a rather lengthened silence in that little group before Harwood
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it struck me that it showed very questionable taste in
      the man to go about flaunting his money in the face of every one he met.
      As for his name&mdash;well, perhaps we had better not say anything about
      his name. You recollect what Tennyson makes Sir Tristram say to his Isolt&mdash;I
      don't mean you, Glaston, I know you only read the pre-Raphaelites&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no one seemed to remember the quotation, or, at any rate, to see the
      happiness of its present application.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T could hardly be
      expected that there should be in the mind of Daireen Gerald a total
      absence of interest in the man who by her aid had been rescued from the
      deep. To be sure, her friend Mrs. Crawford had given her to understand
      that people of taste might pronounce the episode melodramatic, and as this
      word sounded very terrible to Daireen, as, indeed, it did to Mrs. Crawford
      herself, whose apprehension of its meaning was about as vague as the
      girl's, she never betrayed the anxiety she felt for the recovery of this
      man, who was, she thought, equally accountable for the dubious taste
      displayed in the circumstances of his rescue. She began to feel, as Mr.
      Glaston in his delicacy carefully refrained from alluding to this night of
      terror, and as Mrs. Crawford assumed a solemn expression of countenance
      upon the least reference to the girl's participation in the recovery of
      the man with the melodramatic name, that there was a certain bond of
      sympathy between herself and this Oswin Markham; and now and again when
      she found the doctor alone, she ventured to make some inquiries regarding
      him. In the course of a few days she learned a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is behaving handsomely&mdash;most handsomely, my dear,&rdquo; said the
      doctor, one afternoon about a week after the occurrence. &ldquo;He eats
      everything that is given to him and drinks in a like proportion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl felt that this was truly noble on the part of the man, but it was
      scarcely the exact type of information she would have liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&mdash;is he able to speak yet?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak? yes, to be sure. He asked me how he came to be picked up, and I
      told him,&rdquo; continued the doctor, with a smile of gallantry of which
      Daireen did not believe him capable, &ldquo;that he was seen by the most
      charming young lady in the world,&mdash;yes, yes, I told him that, though
      I ran a chance of retarding his recovery by doing so.&rdquo; This was, of
      course, quite delightful to hear, but Daireen wanted to know even more
      about the stranger than the doctor's speech had conveyed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor fellow was a long time in the water, I suppose?&rdquo; she said
      artfully, trying to find out all that the doctor had learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was four days upon that piece of wreck,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave a start that seemed very like a shudder, as she repeated the
      words, &ldquo;Four days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he was on his way home from Australia, where he had been living for
      some years, and the vessel he was in was commanded by some incompetent and
      drunken idiot who allowed it to be struck by a tornado of no extraordinary
      violence, and to founder in mid-ocean. As our friend was a passenger, he
      says, the crew did not think it necessary to invite him to have a seat in
      one of the boats, a fact that accounts for his being alive to-day, for
      both boats were swamped and every soul sent to the bottom in his view. He
      tells me he managed to lash a broken topmast to the stump of the mainmast
      that had gone by the board, and to cut the rigging so that he was left
      drifting when the hull went down. That's all the story, my dear, only we
      know what a hard time of it he must have had during the four days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hard time&mdash;a hard time,&rdquo; Daireen repeated musingly, and without a
      further word she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Glaston, who had been pleased to take a merciful view of her recent
      action of so pronounced a type, found that his gracious attempts to reform
      her plastic taste did not, during this evening, meet with that
      appreciation of which they were undoubtedly deserving. Had he been aware
      that all the time his eloquent speech was flowing on the subject of the
      consciousness of hues&mdash;a theme attractive on account of its delicacy&mdash;the
      girl had before her eyes only a vision of heavy blue skies overhanging
      dark green seas terrible in loneliness&mdash;the monotony of endless waves
      broken only by the appearance in the centre of the waste of a broken mast
      and a ghastly face and clinging lean hands upon it, he would probably have
      withdrawn the concession he had made to Mrs. Crawford regarding the taste
      of her protégée.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, Daireen was not during any of these days thinking about much
      besides this Oswin Markham, though she never mentioned his name even to
      the doctor. At nights when she would look out over the flashing
      phosphorescent waters, she would evermore seem to see that white face
      looking up at her; but now she neither started nor shuddered as she was
      used to do for a few nights after she had seen the real face there. It
      seemed to her now as a face that she knew&mdash;the face of a friend
      looking into her face from the dim uncertain surface of the sea of a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning a few days after her most interesting chat with Doctor
      Campion, she got up even earlier than usual&mdash;before, in fact, the
      healthy pedestrian gentleman had completed his first mile, and went on
      deck. She had, however, just stepped out of the companion when she heard
      voices and a laugh or two coming from the stern. She glanced in the
      direction of the sounds and remained motionless at the cabin door. A group
      consisting of the major, the doctor, and the captain of the steamer were
      standing in the neighbourhood of the wheel; but upon a deck-chair, amongst
      a heap of cushions, a stranger was lying back&mdash;a man with a thin
      brown face and large, somewhat sunken eyes, and a short brown beard and
      moustache; he was holding a cigar in the fingers of his left hand that
      drooped over the arm of the chair&mdash;a long, white hand&mdash;and he
      was looking up to the face of the major, who was telling one of his usual
      stories with his accustomed power. None of the other passengers were on
      deck, with the exception of the pedestrian, who came into view every few
      minutes as he reached the after part of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there at the door of the companion without any motion, looking
      at that haggard face of the stranger. She saw a faint smile light up his
      deep eyes and pass over his features as the major brought out the full
      piquancy of his little anecdote, which was certainly not <i>virginibus
      puerisque</i>. Then she turned and went down again to her cabin without
      seeing how a young sailor was standing gazing at her from the passage of
      the ship's bridge. She sat down in her cabin and waited until the ringing
      of the second bell for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are getting dreadfully lazy, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, as she
      took her seat by the girl's side. &ldquo;Why were you not up as usual to get an
      appetite for breakfast?&rdquo; Then without waiting for an answer, she
      whispered, &ldquo;Do you see the stranger at the other side of the table? That
      is our friend Mr. Oswin Markham; his name does not sound so queer when you
      come to know him. The doctor was right, Daireen: he is a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have made his acquaintance this morning already. I hope Mr.
      Glaston may not think that it was my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Glaston?&rdquo; said Daireen. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you know he is so sensitive in matters like this; he might fancy
      that it would be better to leave this stranger by himself; but considering
      that he will be parting from the ship in a week, I don't think I was wrong
      to let my husband present me. At any rate he is a gentleman&mdash;that is
      one satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen felt that there was every reason to be glad that she was not
      placed in the unhappy position of having taken steps for the rescue of a
      person not accustomed to mix in good society. But she did not even once
      glance down towards the man whose standing had been by a competent judge
      pronounced satisfactory. She herself talked so little, however, that she
      could hear him speak in answer to the questions some good-natured people
      at the bottom of the table put to him, regarding the name of his ship and
      the circumstances of the catastrophe that had come upon it. She also heard
      the young lady who had the peculiar fancy for blue and pink beg of him to
      do her the favour of writing his name in her birthday book.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the hours that elapsed before tiffin Daireen sat with a novel in
      her hand, and she knew that the stranger was on the ship's bridge with
      Major Crawford. The major found his company exceedingly agreeable, for the
      old officer had unfortunately been prodigal of his stories through the
      first week of the voyage, and lately he had been reminded that he was
      repeating himself when he had begun a really choice anecdote. This Mr.
      Markham, however, had never been in India, so that the major found in him
      an appreciative audience, and for the satisfactory narration of a
      chronicle of Hindustan an appreciative audience is an important
      consideration. The major, however, appeared alone at tiffin, for Mr.
      Markham, he said, preferred lying in the sun on the bridge to eating salad
      in the cabin. The young lady with the birthday book seemed a little
      disappointed, for she had just taken the bold step of adding to her
      personal decorations a large artificial moss-rose with glass beads sewed
      all about it in marvellous similitude to early dew, and it would not bear
      being trifled with in the matter of detaching from her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not Mrs. Crawford had conferred with Mr. Glaston on the subject
      of the isolation of Mr. Markham, Daireen, on coming to sit down to the
      dinner-table, found Mrs. Crawford and Mr. Markham standing in the saloon
      just at the entrance to her cabin. She could feel herself flushing as she
      looked up to the man's haggard face while Mrs. Crawford pronounced their
      names, and she knew that the hand she put in his thin fingers was
      trembling. Neither spoke a single word: they only looked at each other.
      Then the doctor came forward with some remark that Daireen did not seem to
      hear, and soon the table was surrounded with the passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he feels nearly as strong as he ever did,&rdquo; whispered Mrs.
      Crawford to the girl as they sat down together. &ldquo;He will be able to leave
      us at St. Helena next week without doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the same evening Daireen was sitting in her usual place far astern. The
      sun had set some time, and the latitude being only a few degrees south of
      the equator, the darkness had already almost come down upon the waters. It
      was dimmer than twilight, but not the solid darkness of a tropical night.
      The groups of passengers had all dispersed or gone forward, and the only
      sounds were the whisperings of the water in the wake of the steamer, and
      the splashing of the flying fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly from the cabin there came the music of the piano, and a low voice
      singing to its accompaniment&mdash;so faint it came that Daireen knew no
      one on deck except herself could hear the voice, for she was sitting just
      beside the open fanlight of the saloon; but she heard every word that was
      sung:

      that Daireen Gerald could not tell when the last note had come. She felt
      that she was in a dream and the sounds she had heard were but a part of
      her dream&mdash;sounds? were these sounds, or merely the effect of
      breathing the lovely shadowy light that swathed the waters? The sounds
      seemed to her the twilight expressed in music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the silence she heard a voice speaking her name. She turned and
      saw Oswin Markham standing beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Gerald,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I owe my life to you. I thank you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could hardly have expressed himself more simply if he had been thanking
      her for passing him a fig at dinner, and yet his words thrilled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; do not say that,&rdquo; she said, in a startled voice. &ldquo;I did nothing&mdash;nothing
      that any one else might not have done. Oh, do not talk of it, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; he said slowly, after a pause. &ldquo;I will never talk of it
      again. I was a fool to speak of it to you. I know now that you understand&mdash;that
      there is no need for me to open my lips to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed,&rdquo; she said, turning her eyes upon his face. &ldquo;I do
      understand.&rdquo; She put out her hand, and he took it in his own&mdash;not
      fervently, not with the least expression of emotion, his fingers closed
      over it. A long time passed before she saw his face in front of her own,
      and felt his eyes looking into her eyes as his words came in a whisper,
      &ldquo;Child&mdash;child, there is a bond between us&mdash;a bond whose token is
      silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept her eyes fixed upon his as he spoke, and long after his words had
      come. She knew he had spoken the truth: there was a bond between them. She
      understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the gaunt face with its large eyes close to her own; her own eyes
      filled with tears, and then came the first token of their bond&mdash;silence.
      She felt his grasp unloosed, she heard him moving away, and she knew that
      she was alone in the silence.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was very
      generally thought that it was a fortunate circumstance for Mr. Oswin
      Markham that there chanced to be in the fore-cabin of the steamer an
      enterprising American speculator who was taking out some hundred dozens of
      ready-made garments for disposal to the diamond miners&mdash;and an equal
      quantity of less durable clothing, in which he had been induced to invest
      some money with a view to the ultimate adoption of clothing by the Kafir
      nation. He explained how he had secured the services of a hard-working
      missionary whom he had sent as agent in advance to endeavour to convince
      the natives that if they ever wished to gain a footing among great
      nations, the auxiliary of clothing towards the effecting of their object
      was worth taking into consideration. When the market for these garments
      would thus be created, the speculator hoped to arrive on the scene and
      make a tolerable sum of money. In rear of his missionary, he had scoured
      most of the islands of the Pacific with very satisfactory results; and he
      said he felt that, if he could but prevail upon his missionary in advance
      to keep steady, a large work of evangelisation could be done in South
      Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the aid of this enterprising person, Mr. Markham was able to clothe
      himself without borrowing from any of the passengers. But about the
      payment for his purchases there seemed likely to be some difficulty. The
      bank order for four hundred pounds was once again in the possession of Mr.
      Markham, but it was payable in England, and how then could he effect the
      transfer of the few pounds he owed the American speculator, when he was to
      leave the vessel at St. Helena? There was no agency of the bank at this
      island, though there was one at the Cape, and thus the question of payment
      became somewhat difficult to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to leave the craft at St. Helena, mister?&rdquo; asked the
      American, stroking his chin thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Markham. &ldquo;I must leave at the island and take the first
      ship to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the awkwardest place on God's footstool, this St. Helena, isn't it?&rdquo;
       said the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see that it is; why do you say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I don't see why you want so partickler to land thar, mister.
      Maybe you'll change yer mind, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said that I must part from this ship there,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Markham
      almost impatiently. &ldquo;I must get this order reduced to money somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I reckon that's about the point, mister.&rdquo; said the speculator. &ldquo;But
      you see if you want to fly it as you say, you'll not breeze about that
      it's needful for you to cut the craft before you come to the Cape. I'd
      half a mind to try and trade with you for that bit of paper ten minutes
      ago, but I reckon that's not what's the matter with me now. No, <i>sir</i>;
      if you want to get rid of that paper without much trouble, just you give
      out that you don't care if you do go on to the Cape; maybe a nibble will
      come from that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean, my good fellow,&rdquo; said Markham; &ldquo;but I can
      only repeat that I will not go on to the Cape. I shall get the money
      somehow and pay you before I leave, for surely the order is as good as
      money to any one living in the midst of civilisation. I don't suppose a
      savage would understand it, but I can't see what objection any one in
      business could make to receiving it at its full value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American screwed up his mouth in a peculiar fashion, and smiled in a
      still more peculiar fashion. He rather fancied he had a small piece of
      tobacco in his waistcoat pocket, nor did the result of a search show that
      he was mistaken; he extracted the succulent morsel and put it into his
      mouth. Then he winked at Mr. Markham, put his hands in his pockets, and
      walked slowly away without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markham looked after him with a puzzled expression. He did not know what
      the man meant to convey by his nods and his becks and his wreathed smiles.
      But just at this moment Mr. Harwood came up; he had of course previously
      made the acquaintance of Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we shall soon be losing you?&rdquo; said Harwood, offering him a
      cigar. &ldquo;You said, I think, that you would be leaving us at St. Helena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I leave at St. Helena, and we shall be there in a few days. You see,
      I am now nearly as strong as ever, thanks to Campion, and it is important
      for me to get to England at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Harwood; &ldquo;your relatives will be very anxious if they
      hear of the loss of the vessel you were in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Markham gave a little laugh, as he said, &ldquo;I have no relatives; and as for
      friends&mdash;well, I suppose I shall have a number now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the fact is I was on my way home from Australia to take up a certain
      property which my father left to me in England. He died six months ago,
      and the solicitors for the estate sent me out a considerable sum of money
      in case I should need it in Australia&mdash;this order for four hundred
      pounds is what remains of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can now easily understand your desire to be at home and settled down,&rdquo;
       said Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to settle down,&rdquo; replied Markham. &ldquo;There are a good many
      places to be seen in the world, small as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who has knocked about in the Colonies is generally glad to settle
      down at home,&rdquo; remarked Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt that is the rule, but I fear I am all awry so far as rules are
      concerned. I haven't allowed my life to be subject to many rules,
      hitherto. Would to God I had! It is not a pleasant recollection for a son
      to go through life with, Harwood, that his father has died without
      becoming reconciled to him&mdash;especially when he knows that his father
      has died leaving him a couple of thousands a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am such a son,&rdquo; said Markham, turning round suddenly. &ldquo;I did all that I
      could to make my father's life miserable till&mdash;a climax came, and I
      found myself in Australia three years ago with an allowance sufficient to
      keep me from ever being in want. But I forget, I'm not a modern Ancient
      Mariner, wandering about boring people with my sad story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harwood, &ldquo;you are not, I should hope. Nor am I so pressed for
      time just now as the wedding guest. You did not go in for a sheep-run in
      Australia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; laughed the other. &ldquo;The only thing I went in for
      was getting through my allowance, until that letter came that sobered me&mdash;that
      letter telling me that my father was dead, and that every penny he had
      possessed was mine. Harwood, you have heard of people's hair turning white
      in a few hours, but you have not often heard of natures changing from
      black to white in a short space; believe me it was so with me. The idea
      that theologians used to have long ago about souls passing from earth to
      heaven in a moment might well be believed by me, knowing as I do how my
      soul was transformed by that letter. I cast my old life behind me, though
      I did not tell any one about me what had happened. I left my companions
      and said to them that I was going up country. I did go up country, but I
      returned in a few days and got aboard the first ship that was sailing for
      England, and&mdash;here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you mean to renew your life of wandering when you reach England?&rdquo;
       said Harwood, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all that there is left for me,&rdquo; said the man bitterly, though a
      change in his tone would have made his words seem very pitiful. &ldquo;I am not
      such a fool as to fancy that a man can sow tares and reap wheat. The
      spring of my life is over, and also the summer, the seed-time and the
      ripening; shall the harvest be delayed then? No, I am not such a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see that you might not rest at home,&rdquo; said Harwood. &ldquo;Surely you
      have some associations in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one that is not wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a man of good family with some money is always certain to make new
      associations for himself, no matter what his life has been. Marriage, for
      instance; it is, I think, an exceedingly sure way of squaring a fellow up
      in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very sure way indeed,&rdquo; laughed Markham. &ldquo;Never mind; in another week I
      shall be away from this society which has already become so pleasant to
      me. Perhaps I shall knock up against you in some of the strange places of
      the earth, Harwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heartily hope so,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But I still cannot see why you
      should not come on with us to the Cape. The voyage will completely restore
      you, you can get your money changed there, and a steamer of this company's
      will take you away two days after you land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot remain aboard this steamer,&rdquo; said Markham quickly. &ldquo;I must leave
      at St. Helena.&rdquo; Then he walked away with that shortness of ceremony which
      steamer voyagers get into a habit of showing to each other without giving
      offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor beggar!&rdquo; muttered Harwood. &ldquo;Wrecked in sight of the haven&mdash;a
      pleasant haven&mdash;yes, if he is not an uncommonly good actor.&rdquo; He
      turned round from where he was leaning over the ship's side smoking, and
      saw the man with whom he had been talking seated in his chair by the side
      of Daireen Gerald. He watched them for some time&mdash;for a long time&mdash;until
      his cigar was smoked to the very end. He looked over the side thoughtfully
      as he dropped the remnant and heard its little hiss in the water; then he
      repeated his words, &ldquo;a wreck.&rdquo; Once more he glanced astern, and then he
      added thoughtfully, &ldquo;Yes, he is right; he had much better part at St.
      Helena&mdash;very much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Markham seemed quite naturally to have found his place in Mrs.
      Crawford's set, exclusive though it was; for somehow aboard ship a man
      amalgamates only with that society for which he is suited; a man is seldom
      to be found out of place on account of certain considerations such as one
      meets on shore. Not even Mr. Glaston could raise any protest against Mr.
      Markham's right to take a place in the midst of the elect of the cabin.
      But the young lady in whose birthday book Mr. Markham had inscribed his
      name upon the first day of his appearance at the table, thought it very
      unkind of him to join the band who had failed to appreciate her toilet
      splendours.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day on which he gave Harwood his brief autobiographical
      outline, Mr. Oswin Markham was frequently by the side of Miss Gerald and
      Mrs. Crawford. But towards night the major felt that it would be unjust to
      allow him to be defrauded of the due amount of narratory entertainment so
      necessary for his comfort; and with these excellent intentions drew him
      away from the others of the set, and, sitting on the secluded bridge,
      brought forth from the abundant resources of his memory a few well-defined
      anecdotes of that lively Arradambad station. But all the while the major
      was narrating the stories he could see that Markham's soul was otherwhere,
      and he began to be disappointed in Mr. Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn't bore you, Markham, my boy,&rdquo; he said as he rose, after having
      whiled away about two hours of the night in this agreeable occupation.
      &ldquo;No, I mustn't bore you, and you look, upon my soul, as if you had been
      suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I assure you, I never enjoyed anything more than that story of&mdash;of&mdash;the
      Surgeon-General and the wife of&mdash;of&mdash;the Commissary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Adjutant-General, you mean,&rdquo; interrupted the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, yes, the Adjutant; a deucedly good story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, not bad, is it? But there goes six bells; I must think about turning
      in. Come and join me in a glass of brandy-and-water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; not to-night&mdash;not to-night. The fact is I feel&mdash;I feel
      queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not quite set on your feet yet, my boy,&rdquo; said the major
      critically. &ldquo;Take care of yourself.&rdquo; And he walked away, wondering if it
      was possible that he had been deceived in his estimate of the nature of
      Mr. Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Markham continued sitting alone in the silence of the deserted
      deck. His thoughts were truly otherwhere. He lay back upon his seat and
      kept his eyes fixed upon the sky&mdash;the sky of stars towards which he
      had looked in agony for those four nights when nothing ever broke in upon
      the dread loneliness of the barren sea but those starlights. The terrible
      recollection of every moment he had passed returned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought how he had heard of men becoming, through sufferings such
      as his, oblivious of everything of their past life&mdash;men who were thus
      enabled to begin life anew without being racked by any dread memories, the
      agony that they had endured being acknowledged by Heaven as expiation of
      their past deeds. That was justice, he felt, and if this justice had been
      done to these men, why had it been withheld from him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could God Himself have added to what I endured?&rdquo; he said, in passionate
      bitterness. &ldquo;God! did I not suffer until my agony had overshot its mark by
      destroying in me the power of feeling agony&mdash;my agony consumed
      itself; I was dead&mdash;dead; and yet I am denied the power of beginning
      my new life under the conditions which are my due. What more can God want
      of man than his life? have I not paid that debt daily for four days?&rdquo; He
      rose from his chair and stood upright upon the deck with clenched hands
      and lips. &ldquo;It is past,&rdquo; he said, after a long pause. &ldquo;From this hour I
      throw the past beneath my feet. It is my right to forget all, and&mdash;I
      have forgotten all&mdash;all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood had truly reason to feel surprised when, on the following day,
      Oswin Markham came up to him, and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right, Harwood: after all, it would be foolish for me
      to part from the ship at St. Helena. I have decided to take your advice
      and run on to the Cape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harwood looked at him for a few moments before he answered slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you see I am amenable to reason: I acknowledge the wisdom of my
      counsellors.&rdquo; But Harwood made no answer, only continued with his eyes
      fixed upon his face. &ldquo;Hang it all,&rdquo; exclaimed Markham, &ldquo;can't you
      congratulate me upon my return to the side of reason? Can't you
      acknowledge that you have been mistaken in me&mdash;that you find I am not
      so pig-headed as you supposed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harwood; &ldquo;you are not pig-headed.&rdquo; And, taking all things into
      consideration, it can hardly be denied that Mr. Oswin Markham's claim to
      be exempted from the class of persons called pig-headed was well founded.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. Crawford felt
      that she was being unkindly dealt with by Fate in many matters. She had
      formed certain plans on coming aboard the steamer and on taking in at a
      glance the position of every one about her&mdash;it was her habit to do so
      on the occasion of her arrival at any new station in the Indian Empire&mdash;and
      hitherto she had generally had the satisfaction of witnessing the success
      of her plans; but now she began to fear that if things continued to
      diverge so widely from the paths which it was natural to expect them to
      have kept, her skilful devices would be completely overthrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford had within the first few hours of the voyage communicated to
      her husband her intention of surprising Colonel Gerald on the arrival of
      his daughter at the Cape; for he could scarcely fail to be surprised and,
      of course, gratified, if he were made aware of the fact that his daughter
      had conceived an attachment for a young man so distinguished in many ways
      as the son of the Bishop of the Calapash Islands and Metropolitan of the
      Salamander Archipelago&mdash;the style and titles of the father of Mr.
      Glaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Daireen, instead of showing herself a docile subject and ready to act
      according to the least suggestion of one who was so much wiser and more
      experienced than herself, had begun to think and to act most waywardly.
      Though she had gone ashore at Madeira contrary to Mr. Glaston's advice,
      and had even ventured to assert, in the face of Mr. Glaston's
      demonstration to the contrary, that she had spent a pleasant day, yet Mrs.
      Crawford saw that it would be quite possible, by care and thoughtfulness
      in the future, to overcome all the unhappy influences her childishness
      would have upon the mind of Mr. Glaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being well aware of this, she had for some days great hope of her
      protégée; but then Daireen had apparently cast to the winds all her sense
      of duty to those who were qualified to instruct her, for she had not only
      disagreed from Mr. Glaston upon a theory he had expressed regarding the
      symbolism of a certain design having for its chief elements sections of
      pomegranates and conventionalised daisies&mdash;Innocence allured by
      Ungovernable Passion was the parable preached through the union of some
      tones of sage green and saffron, Mr. Glaston assured the circle whom he
      had favoured with his views on this subject&mdash;but she had also laughed
      when Mr. Harwood made some whispered remark about the distressing
      diffusion of jaundice through the floral creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was very sad to Mrs. Crawford. She was nearly angry with Daireen, and
      if she could have afforded it, she would have been angry with Mr. Harwood;
      she was, however, mindful of the influence of the letters she hoped the
      special correspondent of the <i>Dominant Trumpeter</i> would be writing
      regarding the general satisfaction that was felt throughout the colonies
      of South Africa that the Home Government had selected so efficient and
      trustworthy an officer to discharge the duties in connection with the Army
      Boot Commission, so she could not be anything but most friendly towards
      Mr. Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was a great grief to Mrs. Crawford to see the man who, though
      undoubtedly well educated and even cultured, was still a sort of
      adventurer, seating himself more than once by the side of Daireen on the
      deck, and to notice that the girl talked with him even when Mr. Glaston
      was near&mdash;Mr. Glaston, who had referred to his sudden arrival aboard
      the ship as being melodramatic. But on the day preceding the expected
      arrival of the steamer at St. Helena, the well-meaning lady began to feel
      almost happy once more, for she recollected how fixed had been Mr.
      Markham's determination to leave the steamer at the island. Being almost
      happy, she thought she might go so far as to express to the man the grief
      which reflecting upon his departure excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall miss you from our little circle, I can assure you, Mr. Markham,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;Your coming was so&mdash;so&rdquo;&mdash;she thought of a substitute
      for melodramatic&mdash;&ldquo;so unexpected, and so&mdash;well, almost romantic,
      that indeed it has left an impression upon all of us. Try and get into a
      room in the hotel at James Town that the white ants haven't devoured; I
      really envy you the delicious water-cress you will have every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be spared the chance of committing that sin, Mrs. Crawford,
      though I fear the penance which will be imposed upon you for having even
      imagined it will be unjustly great. The fact is, I have been so weak as to
      allow myself to be persuaded by Doctor Campion and Harwood to go on to the
      Cape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go on to the Cape!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go on to the Cape, Mrs. Crawford; so you see you will be bored with me
      for another week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford looked utterly bewildered, as, indeed, she was. Her smile
      was very faint as she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how nice; you have been persuaded. Ah, very pleasant it will be; but
      how one may be deceived in judging of another's character! I really formed
      the impression that you were firmness itself, Mr. Markham!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am, Mrs. Crawford, except when my inclination tends in the opposite
      direction to my resolution; then, I assure you, I can be led with a strand
      of floss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was, of course, very pleasant chat, and with the clink of compliment
      about it, but it was anything but satisfactory to the lady to whom it was
      addressed. She by no means felt in the mood for listening to mere
      colloquialisms, even though they might be of the most brilliant nature,
      which Mr. Markham's certainly were not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I fancied that you were firmness itself,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;But you
      allowed your mind to be changed by&mdash;by the doctor and Mr. Harwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not wholly, to say the truth, Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; he interposed. &ldquo;It is
      pitiful to have to confess that I am capable of being influenced by a
      monetary matter; but so it is: the fact is, if I were to land now at St.
      Helena, I should be not only penniless myself, but I should be obliged
      also to run in debt for these garments that my friend Phineas F. Fulton of
      Denver City supplied me with, not to speak of what I feel I owe to the
      steamer itself; so I think it is better for me to get my paper money
      turned into cash at the Cape, and then hurry homewards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you understand your own business,&rdquo; said the lady, smiling
      faintly as she walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Oswin Markham watched her for some moments in a thoughtful way. He had
      known for a considerable time that the major's wife understood her
      business, at any rate, and that she was also quite capable of
      comprehending&mdash;nay, of directing as well&mdash;the business of every
      member of her social circle. But how was it possible, he asked himself,
      that she should have come to look upon his remaining for another week
      aboard the steamer as a matter of concern? He was a close enough observer
      to be able to see from her manner that she did so; but he could not
      understand how she should regard him as of any importance in the
      arrangement of her plans for the next week, whatever they might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Crawford, so soon as she found herself by the side of Daireen in
      the evening, resolved to satisfy herself upon the subject of the
      influences which had been brought to bear upon Mr. Oswin Markham, causing
      his character for determination to be lost for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen was sitting alone far astern, and had just finished directing some
      envelopes for letters to be sent home the next day from St. Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a capital habit to get into of writing on that little case on your
      knee!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;You have been on deck all day, you see, while
      the other correspondents are shut down in the saloon. You have had a good
      deal to tell the old people at that wonderful Irish lake of yours since
      you wrote at Madeira.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen thought of all she had written regarding Standish, to prevent his
      father becoming uneasy about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I have had a good deal of news that will interest them,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I have told them that the Atlantic is not such a terrible place
      after all. Why, we have not had even a breeze yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>we</i> have not, but you should not forget, Daireen, the tornado
      that at least one ship perished in.&rdquo; She looked gravely at the girl,
      though she felt very pleased indeed to know that her protégée had not
      remembered this particular storm. &ldquo;You have mentioned in your letters, I
      hope, how Mr. Markham was saved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I devoted an entire page to Mr. Markham,&rdquo; Daireen replied with
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right, my dear. You have also said, I am sure, how we all hope he
      is&mdash;a&mdash;a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hope?</i>&rdquo; said Daireen quickly. Then she added after a pause, &ldquo;No,
      Mrs. Crawford, I don't think I said that. I only said that he would be
      leaving us to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford's nicely sensitive ear detected, she fancied, a tinge of
      regret in the girl's last tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he told you that he had made up his mind to leave the ship at St.
      Helena, did he not?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is to leave us there, Mrs. Crawford. Did you not understand
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did indeed; but I am disappointed in Mr. Markham. I thought that he was
      everything that is firm. Yes, I am disappointed in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Daireen, with a little flush and an anxious movement of her
      eyes. &ldquo;How do you mean he has disappointed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not going to leave us at St. Helena, Daireen; he is coming on with
      us to the Cape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With sorrow and dismay Mrs. Crawford noticed Daireen's face undergo a
      change from anxiety to pleasure; nor did she allow the little flush that
      came to the girl's forehead to escape her observation. These changes of
      countenance were almost terrifying to the lady. &ldquo;It is the first time I
      have had my confidence in him shaken,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;In spite of what Mr.
      Harwood said of him I had not the least suspicion of this Mr. Markham, but
      now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did! Mr. Harwood say of him?&rdquo; asked Daireen, with a touch of scorn
      in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not get angry, Daireen, my child,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry, Mrs. Crawford? How could you fancy I was angry? Only what right
      had this Mr. Harwood to say anything about Mr. Markham? Perhaps Mr.
      Glaston was saying something too. I thought that as Mr. Markham was a
      stranger every one here would treat him with consideration, and yet, you
      see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Daireen, what can you possibly mean?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford.
      &ldquo;Not a soul has ever treated Mr. Markham except in good taste from the day
      he came aboard this vessel. Of course young men will talk, especially
      young newspaper men, and more especially young <i>Dominant. Trumpeter</i>
      men. For myself, you saw how readily I admitted Mr. Markham into our set,
      though you will allow that, all things considered, I need not have done so
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a stranger,&rdquo; said Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is not therefore an angel unawares, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford,
      smiling as she patted the girl's hand in token of amity. &ldquo;So long as he
      meant, to be a stranger of course we were justified in making him as
      pleasant as possible; but now, you see, he is not going to be a stranger.
      But why should we talk upon so unprofitable a subject? Tell me all the
      rest that you have been writing about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen made an attempt to recollect what were the topics of her letters,
      but she was not very successful in recalling them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told them about the&mdash;the albatross, how it has followed us so
      faithfully,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and how the Cape pigeons came to us yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed. Very nice it will be for the dear old people at home. Ah,
      Daireen, how happy you are to have some place you can look back upon and
      think of as your home. Here am I in my old age still a vagabond upon the
      face of the earth. I have no home, dear.&rdquo; The lady felt that this piece of
      pathos should touch the girl deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, don't say that, my dear Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; Daireen said gently. &ldquo;Say
      that your dear kind goodnature makes you feel at home in every part of the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was very nice Mrs. Crawford felt, as she kissed the face beside her,
      but she did not therefore come to the conclusion that it would be well to
      forget that little expression of pleasure which had flashed over this same
      face a few minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very hour upon the evening following the anchors were being
      weighed, and the good steamer was already backing slowly out from the
      place it had occupied in the midst of the little fleet of whale-ships and
      East Indiamen beneath the grim shadow of that black ocean rock, St.
      Helena. The church spire of James Town was just coming into view as the
      motion of the ship disclosed a larger space of the gorge where the little
      town is built. The flag was being hauled down from the spar at the top of
      Ladder Hill, and the man was standing by the sunset gun aboard H.M.S. <i>Cobra</i>.
      The last of the shore-boats was cast off from the rail, and then, the
      anchor being reported in sight, the steamer put on full speed ahead, the
      helm was made hard-a-starboard, and the vessel swept round out of the
      harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood and Major Crawford were in anxious conversation with an
      engineer officer who had been summoned to the Cape to assist in a certain
      council which was to be held regarding the attitude of a Kafir chief who
      was inclined to be defiant of the lawful possessors of the country. But
      Daireen was standing at the ship's side looking at that wonderful line of
      mountain-wall connecting the batteries round the island. Her thoughts were
      not, however, wholly of the days when there was a reason why this little
      island should be the most strongly fortified in the ocean. As the steamer
      moved gently round the dark cliffs she was not reflecting upon what must
      have been the feelings of the great emperor-general who had been
      accustomed to stand upon these cliffs and to look seaward. Her thoughts
      were indeed undefined in their course, and she knew this when she heard
      the voice of Oswin Markham beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you fancy what would be my thoughts at this time if I had kept to my
      resolution&mdash;and if I were now up there among those big rocks?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, but did not utter a word in answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what would yours have been now if I had kept to my resolution,&rdquo;
       he then said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you, indeed,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I cannot fancy what I should
      be thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor can I tell you what my thought would be,&rdquo; he said after a pause. He
      was leaning with one arm upon the moulding of the bulwarks, and she had
      her eyes still fixed upon the ridges of the island. He touched her and
      pointed out over the water. The sun like a shield of sparkling gold had
      already buried half its disc beneath the horizon. They watched the
      remainder become gradually less and less until only a thread of gold was
      on the water; in another instant this had dwindled away. &ldquo;I know now how I
      should have felt,&rdquo; he said, with his eyes fixed upon the blank horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked out to that blank horizon also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from each fort on the cliffs there leaped a little flash of light,
      and the roar of the sunset guns made thunder all along the hollow shore;
      before the echoes had given back the sound, faint bugle-calls were borne
      out to the ocean as fort answered fort all along that line of
      mountain-wall. The girl listened until the faintest farthest thin sound
      dwindled away just as the last touch of sunlight had waned into blankness
      upon the horizon.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>OWEVER varying,
      indefinite, and objectless the thoughts of Daireen Gerald may have been&mdash;and
      they certainly were&mdash;during the earlier days of the voyage, they were
      undoubtedly fixed and steadfast during the last week. She knew that she
      could not hear anything of her father until she would arrive at the Cape,
      and so she had allowed herself to be buoyed up by the hopeful conversation
      of the major and Mrs. Crawford, who seemed to think of her meeting with
      her father as a matter of certainty, and by the various little excitements
      of every day. But now when she knew that upon what the next few days would
      bring forth all the happiness of her future life depended, what thought&mdash;what
      prayer but one, could she have?
    </p>
    <p>
      She was certainly not good company during these final days. Mr. Harwood
      never got a word from her. Mr. Glaston did not make the attempt, though he
      attributed her silence to remorse at having neglected his artistic
      instructions. Major Crawford's gallantries received no smiling recognition
      from her; and Mrs. Crawford's most motherly pieces of pathos went by
      unheeded so far as Daireen was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      What on earth was the matter, Mrs. Crawford thought; could it be possible
      that her worst fears were realised? she asked herself; and she made a vow
      that even if Mr. Harwood had spoken a single word on the subject of
      affection to Daireen, he should forfeit her own friendship for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Daireen,&rdquo; she said, two days after leaving St. Helena, &ldquo;you know
      I love you as a daughter, and I have come to feel for you as a mother
      might. I know something is the matter&mdash;what is it? you may confide in
      me; indeed you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are!&rdquo; said the child of this adoption; &ldquo;how very good! You
      know all that is the matter, though you have in your kindness prevented me
      from feeling it hitherto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Daireen, you frighten me! No one can have been speaking to
      you surely, while I am your guardian&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what a wretched doubt there is in my mind now that I know a few
      days will tell me all that can be told&mdash;you know the terrible
      question that comes to me every day&mdash;every hour&mdash;shall I see
      him?&mdash;shall he be&mdash;alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the young men, with no touches of motherly pathos about them, had
      appreciated the girl's feelings in those days more readily than Mrs.
      Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear little thing,&rdquo; she now said, fondling her in a way whose
      soothing effect the combined efforts of all the young men could never have
      approached. &ldquo;Don't let the doubt enter your mind for an instant&mdash;it
      positively must not. Your father is as well as I am to-day, I can assure
      you. Can you disbelieve me? I know him a great deal better than you do;
      and I know the Cape climate better than you do. Nonsense, my dear, no one
      ever dies at the Cape&mdash;at least not when they go there to recover.
      Now make your mind easy for the next three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for just this interval poor Daireen's mind was in a state of anything
      but repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last night the steamer would be on the voyage she found it
      utterly impossible to go to sleep. She heard all of the bells struck from
      watch to watch. Her cabin became stifling to her though a cool breeze was
      passing through the opened port. She rose, dressed herself, and went on
      deck though it was about two o'clock in the morning. It was a terrible
      thing for a girl to do, but nothing could have prevented Daireen's taking
      that step. She stood just outside the door of the companion, and in the
      moonlight and soft air of the sea more ease of mind came to her than she
      had yet felt on this voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she stood there in the moonlight listening to the even whisperings
      of the water as it parted away before the ship, and to the fitful flights
      of the winged fish, she seemed to hear some order as she thought, given
      from the forward part of the vessel. In another minute the officer on
      watch hastened past her. She heard him knock at the captain's cabin which
      was just aft of the deck-house, and make the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fixed light right ahead, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew then that the first glimpse of the land which they were
      approaching had been obtained, and her anxiety gave place to peace. That
      message of the light seemed to be ominous of good to her. She returned to
      her cabin, and found it cool and tranquil, so that she fell asleep at
      once; and when she next opened her eyes she saw a tall man standing with
      folded arms beside her, gazing at her. She gave but one little cry, and
      then that long drooping moustache of his was down upon her face and her
      bare arms were about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, Dolly; that is a sufficiently close escape from
      strangulation to make me respect your powers,&rdquo; said the man; and at the
      sound of his voice Daireen turned her face to her pillow, while the man
      shook out with spasmodic fingers his handkerchief from its folds and
      endeavoured to repair the injury done to his moustache by the girl's
      embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now, my Dolly,&rdquo; he said, after some convulsive mutterings which
      Daireen could, of course, not hear; &ldquo;now, now, don't you think it might be
      as well to think of making some apology for your laziness instead of
      trying to go asleep again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she looked up with wondering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand anything at all,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How could I go asleep
      when we were within four hours of the Cape? How could any one be so cruel
      as to let me sleep so dreadfully? It was wicked of me: it was quite
      wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's not the least question about the enormity of the crime, I'm
      afraid,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;only I think that Mrs. Crawford may be responsible
      for a good deal of it, if her confession to me is to be depended upon. She
      told me how you were&mdash;but never mind, I am the ill-treated one in the
      matter, and I forgive you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we have actually been brought into the dock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the past half-hour, my love; and I have been waiting for much longer.
      I got the telegram you sent to me, by the last mail from Madeira, so that
      I have been on the lookout for the <i>Cardwell Castle</i> for a week. Now
      don't be too hard on an old boy, Dolly, with all of those questions I see
      on your lips. Here, I'll take them in the lump, and think over them as I
      get through a glass of brandy-and-water with Jack Crawford and the Sylph&mdash;by
      George, to think of your meeting with the poor old hearty Sylph&mdash;ah,
      I forgot you never heard that we used to call Mrs. Crawford the Sylph at
      our station before you were born. There, now I have got all your
      questions, my darling&mdash;my own darling little Dolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She only gave him a little hug this time, and he hastened up to the deck,
      where Mrs. Crawford and her husband were waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, did I say anything more of her than was the truth, George?&rdquo; cried
      Mrs. Crawford, so soon as Colonel Gerald got on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Colonel Gerald smiled at her abstractedly and pulled fiercely at the
      ends of his moustache. Then seeing Mr. Harwood at the other side of the
      skylight, he ran and shook hands with him warmly; and Harwood, who fancied
      he understood something of the theory of the expression of emotion in
      mankind, refrained from hinting to the colonel that they had already had a
      chat together since the steamer had come into dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford, however, was not particularly well pleased to find that her
      old friend George Gerald had only answered her with that vague smile,
      which implied nothing; she knew that he had been speaking for half an hour
      before with Harwood, from whom he had heard the first intelligence of his
      appointment to the Castaway group. When Colonel Gerald, however, went the
      length of rushing up to Doctor Campion and violently shaking hands with
      him also, though they had been in conversation together before, the lady
      began to fear that the attack of fever from which it was reported
      Daireen's father had been suffering had left its traces upon him still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather rum, by gad,&rdquo; said the major, when his attention was called to his
      old comrade's behaviour. &ldquo;Just like the way a boy would behave visiting
      his grandmother, isn't it? Looks as if he were working off his feelings,
      doesn't it? By gad, he's going back to Harwood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he would,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;Harwood can tell him all about
      his appointment. That's what George, like all the rest of them nowadays,
      is anxious about. He forgets his child&mdash;he has no interest in her, I
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's devilish bad, Kate, devilish bad! by Jingo! But upon my soul, I
      was under the impression that his wildness just now was the effect of
      having been below with the kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had the least concern about her, would he not come to me, when he
      knows very well that I could tell him all about the voyage? But no, he
      prefers to remain by the side of the special correspondent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he doesn't; here he comes, and hang me if he isn't going to shake
      hands with both of us!&rdquo; cried the major, as Colonel Gerald, recognising
      him, apparently for the first time, left Harwood's side and hastened
      across the deck with extended hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, dear old George,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, reflecting upon the
      advantages usually attributed to the conciliatory method of treatment.
      &ldquo;Isn't it like the old time come back again? Here we stand together&mdash;Jack,
      Campion, yourself and myself, just as we used to be in&mdash;ah, it cannot
      have been '58!&mdash;yes, it was, good gracious, '58! It seems like a
      dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly like a dream, by Jingo, my dear,&rdquo; said the major pensively, for
      he was thinking what an auxiliary to the realistic effect of the scene a
      glass of brandy-and-water, or some other Indian cooling drink, would be.
      &ldquo;Just like a vision, you know, George, isn't it? So if you'll come to the
      smoking-room, we'll have that light breakfast we were talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't go, major,&rdquo; said the lady severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wishes to have a talk with me about the dear child. Don't you,
      George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about your dear self, Kate,&rdquo; replied Colonel Gerald, in the Irish way
      that brought back to the lady still more vividly all the old memories of
      the happy station on the Himalayas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how like George that, isn't it?&rdquo; she whispered to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl, don't be a tool,&rdquo; was the parting request of the major as
      he strolled off to where the doctor was, he knew, waiting for some sign
      that the brandy and water were amalgamating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad that we are alone, George,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, taking Colonel
      Gerald's arm. &ldquo;We can talk together freely about the child&mdash;about
      Daireen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have we to say about her, Kate? Can you give me any hints about
      her temper, eh? How she needs to be managed, and that sort of thing? You
      used to be capital at that long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I flatter myself that I can still tell all about a girl after a
      single glance; but, my dear George, I never indeed knew what a truly
      perfect nature was until I came to understand Daireen. She is an angel,
      George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the colonel gently; &ldquo;not Daireen&mdash;she is not the angel;
      but her face, when I saw it just now upon its pillow, sent back all my
      soul in thought of one&mdash;one who is&mdash;who always was an angel&mdash;my
      good angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my first thought too,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;And her nature is
      the same. Only poor Daireen errs on the side of good nature. She is a
      child in her simplicity of thought about every one she meets. She wants
      some one near her who will be able to guide her tastes in&mdash;in&mdash;well,
      in different matters. By the way, you remember Austin Glaston, who was
      chaplain for a while on the <i>Telemachus</i>, and who got made Bishop of
      the Salamanders; well, that is his son, that tall handsome youngman&mdash;I
      must present you. He is one of the most distinguished men I ever met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed? Does he write for a newspaper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, George, I am ashamed of you. No, Mr. Glaston is a&mdash;a&mdash;an
      artist and a poet, and&mdash;well, he does nearly everything much better
      than any one else, and if you take my advice you will give him an
      invitation to dinner, and then you will find out all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Colonel Gerald could utter a word he was brought face to face with
      Mr. Glaston, and felt his grasp responded to by a gentle pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Glaston; your father and I were old
      friends. If you are staying at Cape Town, I hope you will not neglect to
      call upon my daughter and myself,&rdquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are extremely kind,&rdquo; returned the young man: &ldquo;I shall be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Daireen on coming on deck found her father in conversation with Mr.
      Glaston, and already acquainted with every member of Mrs. Crawford's
      circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Glaston has just promised to pay you a visit on shore, my dear,&rdquo; said
      the major's wife, as she came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very kind,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;But can he tell me where I live ashore,
      for no one has thought fit to let me know anything about myself. I will
      never forgive you, Mrs. Crawford, for ordering that I was not to be
      awakened this morning. It was too cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to be kind, dear; I knew what a state of nervousness you were in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now of course,&rdquo; continued the girl, &ldquo;when I come on deck all the news
      will have been told&mdash;even that secret about the Castaway Islands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens':&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;what about the Castaway Islands? Have they
      been submerged, or have they thrown off the British yoke already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you know all,&rdquo; she said mournfully, &ldquo;and I had treasured up all
      that Mr. Harwood said no one in the world but himself knew, to be the
      first to tell you. And now, too, you know every one aboard except&mdash;ah,
      I have my secret to tell at last. There he stands, and even you don't
      remember him, papa. Come here, Standish, and let me present you. This,
      papa, is Standish Macnamara, and he is coming out with us now to wherever
      we are to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Daireen!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Standish, Prince of Innishdermot!&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;My dear boy,
      I am delighted to welcome you to this strange place. I remember you when
      your curls were a good deal longer, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Standish, who was no longer in his sailor's jacket, but in the best
      attire his Dublin tailor could provide, blushed most painfully as every
      one gazed at him&mdash;every one with the exception of Daireen, who was
      gazing anxiously around the deck as though she expected to see some one
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is certainly a secret,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Daireen, to the shore,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald. &ldquo;You need not say
      good-bye to any one here. Mrs. Crawford will be out to dine with us
      to-morrow. She will bring the major and Doctor Campion, and Mr. Harwood
      says he will ride one of my horses till he gets his own. So there need be
      no tears. My man will look after the luggage while I drive you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get my bag from my cabin,&rdquo; Daireen said, going slowly towards the
      companion. In a few moments she reappeared with her dressing-bag, and gave
      another searching glance around the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT an
      extraordinary affair!' said Mrs. Crawford, turning from where she had been
      watching the departure of the colonel and his daughter and that tall
      handsome young friend of theirs whom they had called Standish MacDermot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would not have believed it of Daireen. Standish MacDermot&mdash;what a
      dreadful Irish name! But where can he have been aboard the ship? He cannot
      have been one of those terrible fore-cabin passengers. Ah, I would not
      have believed her capable of such disingenuousness. Who is this young man,
      Jack?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear girl, never mind the young man or the young woman just now. We
      must look after the traps and get them through the Custom-house.' replied
      the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Harwood, who is this young man with the terrible Irish name?' she
      asked in desperation of the special correspondent. She felt indeed in an
      extremity when she sought Harwood for an ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never was so much astonished in all my life,' he whispered in answer.
      'I never heard of him. She never breathed a word about him to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford did not think this at all improbable, seeing that Daireen
      had never breathed a word about him to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear Mr. Harwood, these Irish are too romantic for us. It is
      impossible for us ever to understand them.' And she hastened away to look
      after her luggage. It was not until she was quite alone that she raised
      her hands, exclaiming devoutly, 'Thank goodness Mr. Glaston had gone
      before this second piece of romance was disclosed! What on earth would he
      have thought!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The reflection made the lady shudder. Mr. Glaston's thoughts, if he had
      been present while Daireen was bringing forward this child of mystery,
      Standish MacDermot, would, she knew, have been too terrible to be
      contemplated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Mr. Harwood, though he professed to be affected by nothing that
      occurred about him, still he felt himself uncomfortably surprised by the
      sudden appearance of the young Irishman with whom Miss Gerald and her
      father appeared to be on such familiar terms; and as he stood looking up
      to that marvellous hill in whose shadow Cape Town lies, he came to the
      conclusion that it would be as well for him to find out all that could be
      known about this Standish MacDermot. He had promised Daireen's father to
      make use of one of his horses so long as he would remain at the Cape, and
      it appeared from all he could gather that the affairs in the colony were
      becoming sufficiently complicated to compel his remaining here instead of
      hastening out to make his report of the Castaway group. The British nation
      were of course burning to hear all that could be told about the new island
      colony, but Mr. Harwood knew very well that the heading which would be
      given in the columns of the '<i>Dominant Trumpeter</i>' to any information
      regarding the attitude of the defiant Kafir chief would be in very much
      larger type than that of the most flowery paragraph descriptive of the
      charms of the Castaway group; and so he had almost made up his mind that
      it would be to the advantage of the newspaper that he should stay at the
      Cape. Of course he felt that he had at heart no further interests, and so
      long as it was not conflicting with those interests he would ride Colonel
      Gerald's horse, and, perhaps, walk with Colonel Gerald's daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the time that he was reflecting in this consistent manner the
      colonel and his daughter and Standish were driving along the base of Table
      Mountain, while on the other side the blue waters of the lovely bay were
      sparkling between the low shores of pure white sand, and far away the dim
      mountain ridges were seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I ever come to know that mountain and all about it as well as I
      know our own dear Slieve Docas?' cried the girl, looking around her. 'Will
      you, do you think, Standish?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing here can compare with our Irish land,' cried Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are right my boy,' said Daireen's father. 'I have knocked about a
      good deal, and I have seen a good many places, and, after all, I have come
      to the conclusion that our own Suangorm is worth all that I have seen for
      beauty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We can all sympathise with each other here,' said the girl laughing. 'We
      will join hands and say that there is no place in the world like our
      Ireland, and then, maybe, the strangers here will believe us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said her father, 'we will think of ourselves in the midst of a
      strange country as three representatives of the greatest nation in, the
      world. Eh, Standish, that would please your father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Standish could not make any answer to this allusion to his father. He
      was in fact just now wondering what Colonel Gerald would say when he would
      hear that Standish had travelled six thousand miles for the sake of
      obtaining his advice as to the prudence of entertaining the thought of
      leaving home. Standish was beginning to fear that there was a flaw
      somewhere in the consistency of the step he had taken, complimentary
      though it undoubtedly was to the judgment of Colonel Gerald. He could
      hardly define the inconsistency of which he was conscious, but as the
      phaeton drove rapidly along the red road beside the high peak of the
      mountain he became more deeply impressed with the fact that it existed
      somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing along great hedges of cactus and prickly-pear, and by the side of
      some well-wooded grounds with acres of trim green vineyards, the phaeton
      proceeded for a few miles. The scene was strange to Daireen and Standish;
      only for the consciousness of that towering peak they were grateful. Even
      though its slope was not swathed in heather, it still resembled in its
      outline the great Slieve Docas, and this was enough to make them feel
      while passing beneath it that it was a landmark breathing of other days.
      Half way up the ascent they could see in a ravine a large grove of the
      silver-leaf fir, and the sun-glints among the exquisite white foliage were
      very lovely. Further down the mighty aloes threw forth their thick green
      branches in graceful divergence, and then along the road were numerous
      bullock waggons with Malay drivers&mdash;eighteen or twenty animals
      running in a team. Nothing could have added to the strangeness of the
      scene to the girl and her companion, and yet the shadow of that great hill
      made the land seem no longer weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, just at the foot of the hill, Colonel Gerald turned his horses to
      where there was a broad rough avenue made through a grove of pines, and
      after following its curves for some distance, a broad cleared space was
      reached, beyond which stood a number of magnificent Australian oaks and
      fruit trees surrounding a long low Dutch-built house with an overhanging
      roof and the usual stoëp&mdash;the raised stone border&mdash;in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is our house, my darling,' said the girl's father as he pulled up at
      the door. 'I had only a week to get it in order for you, but I hope you
      will like it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like it?' she cried; 'it is lovelier than any we had in India, and then
      the hill&mdash;the hill&mdash;oh, papa, this is home indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And for me, my own little Dolly, don't you think it is home too?' he said
      when he had his arms about her in the hall. 'With this face in my hands at
      last I feel all the joy of home that has been denied to me for years. How
      often have I seen your face, Dolly, as I sat with my coffee in the evening
      in my lonely bungalow under the palms? The sight of it used to cheer me
      night after night, darling,' but now that I have it here&mdash;here&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Keep it there,' she cried. 'Oh, papa, papa, why should we be miserable
      apart ever again? I will stay with you now wherever you go for ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gerald looked at her for a minute, he kissed her once again upon
      the face, and then burst into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And this is the only result of a voyage made under the protection of Mrs.
      Crawford!' he said. 'My dear, you must have used some charm to have
      resisted her power; or has she lost her ancient cunning? Why, after a
      voyage with Mrs. Crawford I have seen the most devoted daughters desert
      their parents. When I heard that you were coming out with her I feared you
      would allow yourself to be schooled by her into a sense of your duty, but
      it seems you have been stubborn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was everything that is kind to me, and I don't know what I should
      have done without her,' said the girl. 'Only, I'll never forgive her for
      not having awakened me to meet you this morning. But last night I suppose
      she thought I was too nervous. I was afraid, you know, lest&mdash;lest&mdash;but
      never mind, here we are together at home&mdash;for there is the hill&mdash;yes,
      at home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Daireen found herself in the room to which she had been shown by
      the neat little handmaiden provided by Colonel Gerald, and had seated
      herself in sight of a bright green cactus that occupied the centre of the
      garden outside, she had much to think about. She just at this moment
      realised that all her pleasant life aboard the steamer was at an end. More
      than a touch of sadness was in her reflection, for she had come to think
      of the good steamer as something more than a mere machine; it had been a
      home to her for twenty-five days, and it had contained her happiness and
      sorrow during that time as a home would have done. Then how could she have
      parted from it an hour before with so little concern? she asked herself.
      How could she have left it without shaking hands with&mdash;with all those
      who had been by her side for many days on the good old ship? Some she had
      said goodbye to, others she would see again on the following day, but
      still there were some whom she had left the ship without seeing&mdash;some
      who had been associated with her happiness during part of the voyage, at
      any rate, and she might never see them again. The reflection made her very
      sad, nor did the feeling pass off during the rest of the day spent by her
      father's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was very warm, and, as Daireens father was still weak, he did not
      stray away from the house beyond the avenue of shady oaks leading down to
      a little stream that moved sluggishly on its way a couple of hundred yards
      from the garden. They had, of course, plenty to talk about; for Colonel
      Gerald was somewhat anxious to hear how his friend Standish had come out.
      He had expressed the happiness he felt on meeting with the young man as
      soon as his daughter had said that he would go out to wherever they were
      to live, but he thought it would increase his satisfaction if his daughter
      would tell him how it came to pass that this young man was unacquainted
      with any of the passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen now gave him the entire history of Standish's quarrel with his
      father, and declared that it was solely to obtain the advice of Colonel
      Gerald he had made the voyage from Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's father laughed when he heard of this characteristic action on
      the part of the young man; but he declared that it proved he meant to work
      for himself in the world, and not be content to live upon the traditions
      of The Mac-Dermots; and then he promised the girl that something should be
      done for the son of the hereditary prince.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN evening came
      Daireen and her father sat out upon their chairs on the stoëp in front of
      the house. The sun had for long been hidden by the great peak, though to
      the rest of the world not under its shadow he had only just sunk. The
      twilight was very different from the last she had seen on land, when the
      mighty Slieve Docas had appeared in his purple robe. Here the twilight was
      brief and darkly blue as it overhung the arched aloes and those large palm
      plants whose broad leaves waved not in the least breeze. Far in the mellow
      distance a large star was glittering, and the only sound in the air was
      the shrill whistle of one of the Cape field crickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began the struggle between moonlight and darkness. The leaves of the
      boughs that were clasped above the little river began to be softly
      silvered as the influence of the rising light made itself apparent, and
      then the highest ridges of the hill gave back a flash as the beams shot
      through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      These changes were felt by the girl sitting silently beside her father&mdash;the
      changes of the twilight and of the moonlight, before the full round shield
      of the orb appeared above the trees, and the white beams fell around the
      broad floating leaves beneath her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you tired, Dolly?' asked her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not in the least, papa; it seems months since I was at sea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you will ride with me for my usual hour? I find it suits me better
      to take an hour's exercise in the cool of the evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing could be lovelier on such an evening,' she cried. 'It will
      complete our day's happiness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastened to put on her habit while her father went round to the
      stables to give directions to the groom regarding the saddling of a
      certain little Arab which had been bought within the week. In a short time
      Standish was left to gaze in admiration at the fine seat of the old
      officer in his saddle, and in rapture at the delicately shaped figure of
      the girl, as they trotted down the avenue between those strange trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      They disappeared among the great leaves; and when the sound of their
      horses' hoofs had died away, Standish, sitting there upon the raised
      ground in front of the house, had his own hour of thought. He felt that he
      had hitherto not accomplished much in his career of labour. He had had an
      idea that there were a good many of the elements of heroism in joining as
      he did the vessel in which the girl was going abroad. Visions of wrecks,
      of fires, of fallings overboard, nay of pirates even, had floated before
      his mind, with himself as the only one near to save the girl from each
      threatening calamity. He had heard of such things taking place daily, and
      he was prepared to risk himself for her sake, and to account himself happy
      if the chance of protecting her should occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so soon as he had been a few days at sea, and had found that such a
      thing as danger was not even hinted at any more than it would be in a
      drawing-room on shore&mdash;when in fact he saw how like a drawing-room on
      shore was the quarter-deck of the steamer, he began to be disappointed.
      Daireen was surrounded by friends who would, if there might chance to be
      the least appearance of danger, resent his undertaking to save the girl
      whom he loved with every thought of his soul. He would not, in fact, be
      permitted to play the part of the hero that his imagination had marked out
      for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he felt that the heroic elements in his position aboard the steamer
      had somehow dwindled down to a minimum; and now here he had been so weak
      as to allow himself to be induced to come out to live, even though only
      for a short time, at this house. He felt that his acceptance of the
      sisterly friendship of the girl was making it daily more impossible for
      him to kneel at her feet, as he meant one day to do, and beg of her to
      accept of some heroic work done on her behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is worthy of all that a man could do with all his soul,' Standish
      cried as he stood there in the moonlight. But what can I do for her? What
      can I do for her? Oh, I am the most miserable wretch in the whole world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not a very satisfactory conclusion for him to come to; but on the
      whole it did not cause him much despondency. In his Irish nature there
      were almost unlimited resources of hope, and it would have required a
      large number of reverses of fortune to cast him down utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was trying in vain to make himself feel as miserable as he knew
      his situation demanded him to be, Daireen and her father were riding along
      the road that leads from Cape Town to the districts of Wynberg and
      Constantia. They went along through the moonlight beneath the splendid
      avenue of Australian oaks at the old Dutch district of Bondebosch, and
      then they turned aside into a narrow lane of cactus and prickly pear which
      brought them to that great sandy plain densely overgrown with blossoming
      heath and gorse called The Mats, along which they galloped for some miles.
      Turning their horses into the road once more, they then walked them back
      towards their house at Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen felt that she had never before so enjoyed a ride. All was so
      strange. That hill whose peak was once again towering above them; that
      long dark avenue with the myriads of fire-flies sparkling amongst the
      branches; the moonlight that was flooding the world outside; and then her
      companion, her father, whose face she had been dreaming over daily and
      nightly. She had never before so enjoyed a ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had gone some distance through the oak avenue when they turned their
      horses aside at the entrance to one of the large vineyards that are
      planted in such neat lines up the sloping ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Dolly, are you satisfied at last?' said Colonel Gerald, looking
      into the girl's face that the moonlight was glorifying, though here and
      there the shadow of a leaf fell upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Satisfied! Oh, it is all like a dream,' she said. 'A strange dream of a
      strange place. When I think that a month ago I was so different, I feel
      inclined to&mdash;to&mdash;ask you to kiss me again, to make sure I am not
      dreaming.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you are under the impression that you are a sleeping beauty, dear, and
      that you can only be roused by that means, I have no objection.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now I am sure it is all reality,' she said with a little laugh. 'Oh,
      papa, I am so happy. Could anything disturb our happiness?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly upon the dark avenue behind them there came the faint sound of a
      horses hoof, and then of a song sung carelessly through the darkness&mdash;one
      she had heard before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singer was evidently approaching on horseback, for the last notes were
      uttered just opposite where the girl and her father were standing their
      horses behind the trees at the entrance to the vineyard. The singer too
      seemed to have reined in at this point, though of course he could not see
      either of the others, the branches were so close. Daireen was mute while
      that air was being sung, and in another instant she became aware of a
      horse being pushed between the trees a few yards from her. There was only
      a small space to pass, so she and her father backed their horses round and
      the motion made the stranger start, for he had not perceived them before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg you will not move on my account. I did not know there was anyone
      here, or I should not have&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      The light fell upon the girl's face, and her father saw the stranger give
      another little start.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You need not make an apology to us, Mr. Markham,' said Daireen. 'We had
      hidden ourselves, I know. Papa, this is Mr. Oswin Markham. How odd it is
      that we should meet here upon the first evening of landing! The Cape is a
      good deal larger than the quarterdeck of the &ldquo;Cardwell Castle.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You were a passenger, no doubt, aboard the steamer my daughter came out
      in, Mr. Markham?' said Colonel Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Markham laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my word I hardly know that I am entitled to call myself a
      passenger,' he said. 'Can you define my position, Miss Gerald? it was
      something very uncertain. I am a castaway&mdash;a waif that was picked up
      in a half-drowned condition from a broken mast in the Atlantic, and
      sheltered aboard the hospitable vessel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is very rarely that a steamer is so fortunate as to save a life in
      that way,' said Colonel Gerald. 'Sailing vessels have a much better
      chance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To me it seems almost a miracle&mdash;a long chain of coincidences was
      necessary for my rescue, and yet every link was perfect to the end.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is upon threads our lives are constantly hanging,' said the colonel,
      backing his horse upon the avenue. 'Do you remain long in the colony, Mr.
      Markham?' he asked when they were standing in a group at a place where the
      moonlight broke through the branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I shall have to remain for some weeks,' he answered. 'Campion
      tells me I must not think of going to England until the violence of the
      winter there is past.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then we shall doubtless have the pleasure of meeting you frequently. We
      have a cottage at Mowbray, where we would be delighted to see you. By the
      way, Mrs. Crawford and a few of my other old friends are coming out to
      dine with us to-morrow, my daughter and myself would be greatly pleased if
      you could join us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are exceedingly kind,' said Mr. Markham. 'I need scarcely say how
      happy I will be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our little circle on board the good old ship is not yet to be dispersed,
      you see, Mr. Markham,' said Daireen with a laugh. 'For once again, at any
      rate, we will be all together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For once again,' he repeated as he raised his hat, the girl's horse and
      her father's having turned. 'For once again, till when goodbye, Miss
      Gerald.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Goodbye, Mr. Markham,' said the colonel. 'By the way, we dine early I
      should have told you&mdash;half past six.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Markham watched them ride along the avenue and reappear in the moonlight
      space beyond. Then he dropped the bridle on his horse's neck and
      listlessly let the animal nibble at the leaves on the side of the road for
      a long time. At last he seemed to start into consciousness of everything.
      He gathered up the bridle and brought the horse back to the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is Fate or Providence or God this time,' he muttered as if for his own
      satisfaction. 'I have had no part in the matter; I have not so much as
      raised my hand for this, and yet it has come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked his horse back to Cape Town in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think you mentioned this Mr. Markham's name to me, Dolly,' said
      Colonel Gerald as they returned to Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think I did, papa; but you see he had gone ashore when I came on
      deck to you this morning, and I did not suppose we should ever meet
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope you do not object to my asking him to dinner, dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I object, papa? Oh, no, no; I never felt so glad at anything. He does not
      talk affectedly like Mr. Glaston, nor cleverly like Mr. Harwood, so I
      prefer him to either of them. And then, think of his being for a week
      tossing about the Atlantic upon that wreck.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All very good reasons for asking him to dine to-morrow,' said her father.
      'Now suppose we try a trot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would rather walk if it is the same to you, papa,' she said. 'I don't
      feel equal to another trot now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, surely, you have not allowed yourself to become tired, Daireen? Yes,
      my dear, you look it. I should have remembered that you are just off the
      sea. We will go gently home, and you will get a good sleep.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They did go very gently, and silently too, and in a short time Daireen was
      lying on her bed, thinking not of the strange moonlight wonders of her
      ride, but of that five minutes spent upon the avenue of Australian oaks
      down which had echoed that song.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that poor Mrs. Crawford was destined to have enigmas of the most
      various sorts thrust upon her for her solution; at any rate she regarded
      the presence of Mr. Oswin Markham at Colonel Crawford's little dinner the
      next, evening as a question as puzzling as the mysterious appearance of
      the young man called Standish MacDermot. She, however, chatted with Mr.
      Markham as usual, and learned that he also was going to a certain garden
      party which was to be held at Government House in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you will come too, Daireen?' she said. 'You must come, for Mr.
      Glaston has been so good as to promise to exhibit in one of the rooms a
      few of his pictures he spoke to us about. How kind of him, isn't it, to
      try and educate the taste of the colony?' The bishop has not yet arrived
      at the Cape, but Mr. Glaston says he will wait for him for a fortnight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For a fortnight? Such filial devotion will no doubt bring its own
      reward,' said Mr. Harwood.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE band of the
      gallant Bayonetteers was making the calm air of Government House gardens
      melodious with the strains of an entrancing German valse not more than a
      year old, which had convulsed society at Cape Town when introduced a few
      weeks previously; for society at Cape Town, like society everywhere else,
      professes to understand everything artistic, even to the delicacies of
      German dance music. The evening was soft and sunny, while the effect of a
      very warm day drawing near its close was to be seen everywhere around. The
      broad leaves of the feathery plants were hanging dry and languid across
      the walks, and the grass was becoming tawny as that on the Lion's Head&mdash;that
      strangely curved hill beside Table Mountain. The giant aloes and plantains
      were, however, defiant of the heat and spread their leaves out mightily as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardens are always charming in the southern spring, but never so
      charming as when their avenues are crowded with coolly dressed girls of
      moderate degrees of prettiness whose voices are dancing to the melody of a
      German valse not more than a year old. How charming it is to discuss all
      the absorbing colonial questions&mdash;such as how the beautiful Van der
      Veldt is looking this evening; and if Miss Van Schmidt, whose papa belongs
      to the Legislative Council and is consequently a voice in the British
      Empire, has really carried out his threat of writing home to the War
      Office to demand the dismissal of that young Mr. Westbury from the corps
      of Royal Engineers on account of his conduct towards Miss Van Schmidt; or
      perhaps a question of art, such as how the general's daughters contrive to
      have Paris bonnets several days previous to the arrival of the mail with
      the patterns; or a question of diplomacy, such as whether His Excellency's
      private secretary will see his way to making that proposal to the second
      eldest daughter of one of the Supreme Court judges. There is no colony in
      the world so devoted to discussions of this nature as the Cape, and in no
      part of the colony may a discussion be carried out with more spirit than
      in the gardens around Government House.
    </p>
    <p>
      But upon the afternoon of this garden party there was an unusual display
      of colonial beauty and colonial young men&mdash;the two are never found in
      conjunction&mdash;and English delicacy and Dutch <i>gaucherie</i>, for the
      spring had been unusually damp, and this was the first garden party day
      that was declared perfect. There were, of course, numbers of officers, the
      military with their wives&mdash;such as had wives, and the naval with
      other people's wives, each branch of the service grumbling at the other's
      luck in this respect. And then there were sundry civil servants of exalted
      rank&mdash;commissioners of newly founded districts, their wives and
      daughters, and a brace of good colonial bishops also, with their partners
      in their mission labours, none of whom objected to Waldteufel or Gung'l.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the large lawn in front of the balcony at the Residence there was a
      good deal of tennis being played, and upon the tables laid out on the
      balcony there were a good many transactions in the way of brandy and soda
      carried on by special commissioners and field officers, whose prerogative
      it was to discuss the attitude of the belligerent Kafir chief who, it was
      supposed, intended to give as much trouble as he could without
      inconvenience to himself. And then from shady places all around the
      avenues came the sounds of girlish laughter and the glimmer of muslin.
      Behind this scene the great flat-faced, flat-roofed mountain stood dark
      and bold, and through it all the band of the Bayonetteers brayed out that
      inspiriting valse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Crawford was, in consequence of the importance of his mission to the
      colony, pointed out to the semi-Dutch legislators, each of whom had much
      to tell him on the burning boot question; and Mr. Harwood was naturally
      enough, regarded with interest, for the sounds of the 'Dominant Trumpeter'
      go forth into all the ends of the earth. Mr. Glaston, too, as son of the
      Metropolitan of the Salamander Archipelago, was entitled to every token of
      respectful admiration, even if he had not in the fulness of his heart
      allowed a few of his pictures to be hung in one of the reception rooms.
      But perhaps Daireen Gerald had more eyes fixed upon her than anyone in the
      gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone knew that she was the daughter of Colonel Gerald who had just
      been gazetted Governor-General of the new colony of the Castaway Islands,
      but why she had come out to the Cape no one seemed to know exactly. Many
      romances were related to account for her appearance, the Cape Town people
      possessing almost unlimited resources in the way of romance making; but as
      no pains were taken to bring about a coincidence of stories, it was
      impossible to say who was in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dressed so perfectly according to Mr. Glaston's theories of
      harmony that he could not refrain from congratulating her&mdash;or rather
      commending her&mdash;upon her good taste, though it struck Daireen that
      there was not much good taste in his commendation. He remained by her side
      for some time lamenting the degradation of the colony in being shut out
      from Art&mdash;the only world worth living in, as he said; then Daireen
      found herself with some other people to whom she had been presented, and
      who were anxious to present her to some relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's dress was looked at by most of the colonial young ladies, and
      her figure was gazed at by all of the men, until it was generally
      understood that to have made the acquaintance of Miss Gerald was a
      happiness gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear George,' said Mrs. Crawford to Colonel Gerald when she had
      contrived to draw him to her side at a secluded part of the gardens,&mdash;'My
      dear George, she is far more of a success than even I myself anticipated.
      Why, the darling child is the centre of all attraction.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor little Dolly! that is not a very dizzy point to reach at the Cape,
      is it, Kate?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now don't be provoking, George. We all know well enough, of course, that
      it is here the same as at any place else: the latest arrival has the charm
      of novelty. But it is not so in Daireen's case. I can see at once&mdash;and
      I am sure you will give me credit for some power of perception in these
      things&mdash;that she has created a genuine impression. George, you may
      depend on her receiving particular attention on all sides.' The lady's
      voice lowered confidentially until her last sentence had in it something
      of the tone of a revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That will make the time pass in a rather lively way for Dolly,' said
      George, pulling his long iron-grey moustache as he smiled thoughtfully,
      looking into Mrs. Crawford's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, George, you must fully recognise the great responsibility resting
      with you&mdash;I certainly feel how much devolves upon myself, being as I
      am, her father's oldest friend in the colony, and having had the dear
      child in my care during the voyage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing could be stronger than your claims.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then is it not natural that I should feel anxious about her, George? This
      is not India, you must remember.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' said the colonel thoughtfully; 'it's not India.' He was trying
      to grasp the exact thread of reasoning his old friend was using in her
      argument. He could not at once see why the fact of Cape Town not being
      situated in the Empire of Hindustan should cause one's responsible duties
      to increase in severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know what I mean, George. In India marriage is marriage, and a
      certain good, no matter who is concerned in it. It is one's duty there to
      get a girl married, and there is no blame to be attached to one if
      everything doesn't turn out exactly as one could have wished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes, exactly,' said the colonel, beginning to comprehend. 'But I
      think you have not much to reproach yourself with, Kate; almost every mail
      brought you out an instalment of the youth and beauty of home, and I don't
      think that one ever missed fire&mdash;failed to go off, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes, I may say I was fortunate, George,' she replied, with a smile
      of reflective satisfaction. 'But this is not India, George; we must be
      very careful. I observed Daireen carefully on the voyage, and I can safely
      say that the dear child has yet formed no attachment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Formed an attachment? You mean&mdash;oh Kate, the idea is too absurd,'
      said Colonel Gerald. 'Why, she is a child&mdash;a baby.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course all fathers think such things about their girls,' said the lady
      with a pitying smile. 'They understand their boys well enough, and take
      good care to make them begin to work not a day too late, but their girls
      are all babies. Why, George, Daireen must be nearly twenty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gerald was thoughtful for some moments. 'So she is,' he said; 'but
      she is still quite a baby.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Even so,' said the lady, 'a baby's tastes should be turned in the right
      direction. By the way, I have been asked frequently who is this young Mr.
      MacDermot who came out to you in such a peculiar fashion. People are
      beginning to talk curiously about him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As people at the Cape do about everyone,' said the colonel. 'Poor
      Standish might at least have escaped criticism.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I scarcely think so, George, considering how he came out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it was rather what people who do not understand us call an Irish
      idea. Poor boy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is he, George?' 'The son of one of our oldest friends. The friendship
      has existed between his family and mine for some hundreds of years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did he come out to the Cape in that way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear Kate, how can I tell you everything?' said the puzzled colonel.
      'You would not understand if I were to try and explain to you how this
      Standish MacDermot's father is a genuine king, whose civil list
      unfortunately does not provide for the travelling expenses of the members
      of his family, so that the young man thought it well to set out as he
      did.' 'I hope you are not imposing on me, George. Well, I must be
      satisfied, I suppose. By the way, you have not yet been to the room where
      Mr. Glaston's pictures are hung; we must not neglect to see them. Mr.
      Glaston told me just now he thought Daireen's taste perfect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was very kind of Mr. Glaston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you knew him as I do, George&mdash;in fact as he is known in the most
      exclusive drawing-rooms in London&mdash;you would understand how much his
      commendation is worth,' said Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have no doubt of it. He must come out to us some evening to dinner. For
      his father's sake I owe him some attention, if not for his remark to you
      just now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope you may not forget to ask him,' said Mrs. Crawford. 'He is a most
      remarkable young man. Of course he is envied by the less accomplished, and
      you may hear contradictory reports about him. But, believe me, he is
      looked upon in London as the leader of the most fashionable&mdash;that is&mdash;the
      most&mdash;not most learned&mdash;no, the most artistic set in town. Very
      exclusive they are, but they have done ever so much good&mdash;designing
      dados, you know, and writing up the new pomegranate cottage wall-paper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid that Mr. Glaston will find my Hutch cottage deficient in
      these elements of decoration,' remarked the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wanted to talk to you about him for a long time,' said Mrs. Crawford.
      'Not knowing how you might regard the subject, I did not think it well to
      give him too much encouragement on the voyage, George, so that perhaps he
      may have thought me inclined to repel him, Daireen being in my care; but I
      am sure that all may yet be well. Hush! who is it that is laughing so
      loud? they are coming this way. Ah, Mr. Markham and that little Lottie
      Vincent. Good gracious, how long that girl is in the field, and how well
      she wears her age! Doesn't she look quite juvenile?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gerald could not venture an answer before the young lady, who was
      the eldest daughter of the deputy surgeon-general, tripped up to Mrs.
      Crawford, and cried, clasping her four-button strawberry-ice-coloured
      gloves over the elder lady's plump arm, 'Dear good Mrs. Crawford, I have
      come to you in despair to beg your assistance. Promise me that you will do
      all you can to help me.' 'If your case is so bad, Lottie, I suppose I
      must. But what am I to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are to make Mr. Markham promise that he will take part in our
      theatricals next month. He can act&mdash;I know he can act like Irving or
      Salvini or Terry or Mr. Bancroft or some of the others, and yet he will
      not promise to take any part. Could anything be more cruel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing, unless I were to take some part,' said Mr. Markham, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush, sir,' cried the young lady, stamping her Pinet shoe upon the
      ground, and taking care in the action to show what a remarkably
      well-formed foot she possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is cruel of you to refuse a request so offered, Mr. Markham,' said
      Mrs. Crawford. 'Pray allow yourself to be made amenable to reason, and
      make Miss Vincent happy for one evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Since you put it as a matter of reason, Mrs. Crawford, there is, I fear,
      no escape for me,' said Mr. Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Didn't I talk to you about reason, sir?' cried the young lady in very
      pretty mock anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You talked <i>about</i> it,' said Markham, 'just as we walked about that
      centre bed of cactus, we didn't once touch upon it, you know. You talk
      very well about a subject, Miss Vincent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was there ever such impertinence? Mrs. Crawford, isn't it dreadful? But
      we have secured him for our cast, and that is enough. You will take a
      dozen tickets of course, Colonel Gerald?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can confidently say the object is most worthy,' said Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he doesn't know what it is yet,' said Lottie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's why I can confidently recommend it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now do give me five minutes with Colonel Gerald, like a good dear,' cried
      the young lady to Mrs. Crawford! 'I must persuade him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are going to see Mr. Glaston's pictures,' replied Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How delightful! That is what I have been so anxious to do all the
      afternoon: one feels so delightfully artistic, you know, talking about
      pictures; and people think one knows all about them. Do let us go with
      you, Mrs. Crawford. I can talk to Colonel Gerald while you go on with Mr.
      Markham.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are a sad little puss,' said Mrs. Crawford, shaking her finger at the
      artless and ingenuous maiden; and as she walked on with Mr. Markham she
      could not help remembering how this little puss had caused herself to be
      pretty hardly spoken about some ten years before at the Arradambad station
      in the Himalayahs.
    </p>
    <p>
      How well she was wearing her age to be sure, Mrs. Crawford thought. It is
      not many young ladies who, after ten years' campaigning, can be called sad
      little pusses; but Miss Vincent still looked quite juvenile&mdash;in fact,
      <i>plus Arabe qu'en Arabie</i>&mdash;more juvenile than a juvenile.
      Everyone knew her and talked of her in various degrees of familiarity; it
      was generally understood that an acquaintanceship of twenty-four hours'
      duration was sufficient to entitle any field officer to call her by the
      abbreviated form of her first name, while a week was the space allowed to
      subalterns.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> AM so glad to be
      beside some one who can tell me all I want to know' said Lottie, looking
      up to Colonel Gerald's bronzed face when Mrs. Crawford and Markham had
      walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear Lottie, you know very well that you know as much as I do,' he
      answered, smiling down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Colonel Gerald, how can you say such a thing?' she cried innocently.
      'You know I am always getting into scrapes through my simplicity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have managed to get out of a good many in your time, my dear. Is it
      by the same means you got out of them, Lottie-your simplicity?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you are as amusing as ever,' laughed the young thing. 'But you must
      not be hard upon poor little me, now that I want to ask you so much. Will
      you tell me, like a dear good colonel&mdash;I know you can if you choose&mdash;what
      is the mystery about this Mr. Markham?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mystery? I don't hear of any mystery about him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, all your friends came out in the some steamer as he did. They must
      have told you. Everybody here is talking about him. That's why I want him
      for our theatricals: everyone will come to see him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if the mystery, whatever it may be, remains unrevealed up to the
      night of the performance, you will have a house all the more crowded.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I want to know all about it for myself. Is it really true that he had
      fallen overboard from another ship, and was picked up after being several
      weeks at sea?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You would be justified in calling that a mystery, at any rate,' said
      Colonel Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is what some people here are saying, I can assure you,' she cried
      quickly. 'Others say that he was merely taken aboard the steamer at St.
      Helena, after having been wrecked; but that is far too unromantic.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes, far too unromantic.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you do know the truth? Oh, please tell it to me. I have always said
      I was sure it was true that a girl on the steamer saw him floating on the
      horizon with an unusually powerful pilot-glass.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather mysterious for a fellow to be floating about on the horizon with a
      pilot-glass, Lottie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a shame to make fun of me, especially as our performance is in the
      cause of charity, and I want Mr. Markham's name to be the particular
      attraction! Do tell me if he was picked up at sea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe he was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How really lovely! Floating about on a wreck and only restored after
      great difficulty! Our room should be filled to the doors. But what I can't
      understand, Colonel Gerald, is where he gets the money he lives on here.
      He could not have had much with him when he was picked up. But people say
      he is very rich.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then no doubt people have been well informed, my dear. But all I know is
      that this Mr. Markham was on his way from New Zealand, or perhaps
      Australia, and his vessel having foundered, he was picked up by the
      &ldquo;Cardwell Castle&rdquo; and brought to the Cape. He had a note for a few hundred
      pounds in his pocket which he told me he got cashed here without any
      difficulty, and he is going to England in a short time. Here we are at the
      room where these pictures are said to be hanging. Be sure you keep up the
      mystery, Lottie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you have had your little chat, I hope,' said Mrs. Crawford, waiting
      at the door of Government House until Colonel Gerald and Lottie had come
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A delightful little chat, as all mine with Colonel Gerald are,' said
      Lottie, passing over to Mr. Markham. 'Are you going inside to see the
      pictures, Mrs. Crawford?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not just yet, my dear; we must find Miss Gerald,' said Mrs. Crawford, who
      had no particular wish to remain in close attachment to Miss Vincent for
      the rest of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Markham and I are going in,' said Lottie. 'I do so dote upon
      pictures, and Mr. Markham can explain them I know; so <i>au revoir</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed the dainty tips of her gloves and passed up to the small piazza
      at the House, near where Major Crawford and some of the old Indians were
      sitting drinking their brandy and soda and revolving many memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us not go in for a while, Mr. Markham,' she said. 'Let us stay here
      and watch them all. Isn't it delightfully cool here? How tell me all that
      that dreadful old Mrs. Crawford was saying to you about me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my word,' said Markham smiling, 'it <i>is</i> delightfully cool up
      here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know she said ever so much; she does so about everyone who has at any
      time run against her and her designs. She's always designing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you ran against her, you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I did,' cried Lottie, turning round and giving an almost
      indignant look at the man beside her. 'And she has been saying nasty
      things about me ever since; only of course they have never injured me, as
      people get to understand her in a very short time. But what did she say
      just now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing, I can assure you, that was not very much in favour of the
      theatrical idea I have just promised to work out with you, Miss Vincent:
      she told me you were a&mdash;a capital actress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She said that, did she? Spiteful old creature! Just see how she is all
      smiles and friendliness to Mr. Harwood because she thinks he will say
      something about her husband's appointment and the satisfaction it is
      giving in the colony in his next letter to the &ldquo;Trumpeter.&rdquo; That is
      Colonel Gerald's daughter with them now, is it not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that is Miss Gerald,' answered Markham, looking across the lawn to
      where Daireen was standing with Mr. Harwood and some of the tennis-players
      as Mrs. Crawford and her companion came up with Mr. Glaston, whom they had
      discovered and of whom the lady had taken possession. The girl was
      standing beneath the broad leaf of a plantain with the red sunlight
      falling behind her and lighting up the deep ravine of the mountain beyond.
      Oswin thought he had never before seen her look so girlishly lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How people here do run after every novelty!' remarked Miss Vincent, who
      was certainly aware that she herself was by no means a novelty. 'Just
      because they never happen to have seen that girl before, they mob her to
      death. Isn't it too bad? What extremes they go to in their delight at
      having found something new! I actually heard a gentleman say to-day that
      he thought Miss Geralds face perfect. Could anything be more absurd, when
      one has only to see her complexion to know that it is extremely defective,
      while her nose is&mdash;are you going in to the pictures so soon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I think so,' said Markham. 'If we don't see them now it will be too
      dark presently.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I had no idea you were such a devotee of Art,' she cried. 'Just let
      me speak to papa for a moment and I will submit myself to your guidance.'
      And she tripped away to where the surgeon-general was smoking among the
      old Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswin Markham waited at the side of the balcony, and then Mrs. Crawford
      with her entire party came up, Mr. Glaston following with Daireen, who
      said, just as she was beside Mr. Markham, 'We are all going to view the
      pictures, Mr. Markham; won't you join us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am only waiting for Miss Vincent,' he answered. Then Daireen and her
      companion passed into the room containing the four works meant to be
      illustrative of that perfect conception of a subject, and of the only true
      method of its treatment, which were the characteristics assigned to
      themselves by a certain section of painters with whom Mr. Glaston enjoyed
      communion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pictures had, by Mr. Glaston's direction, been hung in what would
      strike an uncultured mind as being an eccentric fashion. But, of course,
      there was a method in it. Each painting was placed obliquely at a window;
      the natural view which was to be obtained at a glance outside being
      supposed to have a powerful influence upon the mind of a spectator in
      preparing him to receive the delicate symbolism of each work.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One of our theories is, that a painting is not merely an imitation of a
      part of nature, but that it becomes, if perfectly worked out in its
      symbolism, a pure creation of Nature herself,' said Mr. Glaston airily, as
      he condescended to explain his method of arrangement to his immediate
      circle. There were only a few people in the room when Mrs. Crawford's
      party entered. Mr. Glaston knew, of course, that Harwood was there, but he
      felt that he could, with these pictures about him, defy all the criticism
      of the opposing school.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a beautiful idea,' said Mrs. Crawford; 'is it not, Colonel Gerald?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital idea,' said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rubbish!' whispered Harwood to Markham, who entered at this moment with
      Lottie Vincent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The absurdity&mdash;the wickedness&mdash;of hanging pictures in the
      popular fashion is apparent to every thoughtful mind,' said the prophet of
      Art. 'Putting pictures of different subjects in a row and asking the
      public to admire them is something too terrible to think about. It is the
      act of a nation of barbarians. To hold a concert and perform at the same
      instant selections from Verdi, Wagner, Liszt, and the Oxford music-hall
      would be as consistent with the principles of Art as these Gallery
      exhibitions of pictures.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How delightful!' cried Lottie, lifting up her four-buttoned gloves in
      true enthusiasm. 'I have often thought exactly what he says, only I have
      never had courage to express myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It needs a good deal of courage,' remarked Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a pity it is that people will continue to be stupid!' said Mrs.
      Crawford. 'For my own part, I will never enter an Academy exhibition
      again. I am ashamed to confess that I have never missed a season when I
      had the chance, but now I see the folly of it all. What a lovely scene
      that is in the small black frame! Is it not, Daireen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you perceive the Idea?' said Mr. Glaston as the girl and Mrs.
      Crawford stood before a small picture of a man and a woman in a
      pomegranate grove in a grey light, the man being in the act of plucking
      the fruit. 'You understand, of course, the symbolism of the pomegranate
      and the early dawn-light among the boughs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a darling picture,' said Lottie effusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never saw such carelessness in drawing before,' said Harwood so soon as
      Mr. Glaston and his friends had passed on to another work.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The colour is pretty fair, but the drawing is ruffianly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you terrible critic!' cried Lottie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You spoil one's enjoyment of the pictures. But I quite agree with you;
      they are fearful daubs,' she added in a whisper. 'Let us stay here and
      listen to the gushing of that absurd old woman; we need not be in the back
      row in looking at that wonderful work they are crowding about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not particularly anxious to stand either in the front or the second
      row,' said Harwood. 'The pavement in the picture is simply an atrocity. I
      saw the thing before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So Harwood, Lottie, and Markham stood together at one of the open windows,
      through which were borne the brazen strains of the distant band, and the
      faint sounds of the laughter of the lawn-tennis players, and the growls of
      the old Indians on the balcony. Daireen and the rest of the party had gone
      to the furthest window from which at an oblique angle one of the pictures
      was placed. Miss Vincent and Harwood soon found themselves chatting
      briskly; but Markham stood leaning against the wall behind them, with his
      eyes fixed upon Daireen, who was looking in a puzzled way at the picture.
      Markham wondered what was the element that called for this puzzled&mdash;almost
      troubled expression upon her face, but he could not see anything of the
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How very fine, is it not, George?' said Mrs. Crawford to Colonel Gerald
      as they stood back to gaze upon the painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I'll go out and have a smoke,' replied the colonel smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford cast a reproachful glance towards him as he turned away, but
      Mr. Glaston seemed oblivious to every remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it not wonderful, Daireen?' whispered Mrs. Crawford to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Daireen, 'I think it is&mdash;wonderful,' and the expression
      upon her face became more troubled still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture was composed of a single figure&mdash;a half-naked,
      dark-skinned female with large limbs and wild black hair. She was standing
      in a high-roofed oriental kiosk upon a faintly coloured pavement, gazing
      with fierce eyes upon a decoration of the wall, representing a battle in
      which elephants and dromedaries were taking part. Through one of the
      arched windows of the building a purple hill with a touch of sunset
      crimson upon its ridge was seen, while the Evening Star blazed through the
      dark blue of the higher heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen looked into the picture, and when she saw the wild face of the
      woman she gave a shudder, though she scarcely knew why.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All but the face,' she said. 'It is too terrible&mdash;there is nothing
      of a woman about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear child, that is the chief wonder of the picture,' said Mr.
      Glaston. 'You recognise the subject, of course?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It might be Cleopatra,' said Daireen dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, hush, hush! never think of such a thing again,' said Mr. Glaston with
      an expression that would have meant horror if it had not been tempered
      with pity. 'Cleopatra is vulgar&mdash;vulgar&mdash;popular. That is
      Aholibah.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You remember, of course, my dear,' said Mrs. Crawford; 'she is a young
      woman in the Bible&mdash;one of the old parts&mdash;Daniel or Job or
      Hezekiah, you know. She was a Jewess or an Egyptian or something of that
      sort, like Judith, the young person who drove a nail into somebody's brain&mdash;they
      were always doing disagreeable things in those days. I can't recollect
      exactly what this dreadful creature did, but I think it was somehow
      connected with the head of John the Baptist.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, no,' said Daireen, still keeping her eyes fixed upon the face of
      the figure as though it had fascinated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aholibah the painter has called it,' said
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Glaston. 'But it is the symbolism of the picture that is most
      valuable. Wonderful thought that is of the star&mdash;Astarte, you know
      &mdash;shedding the light by which the woman views the picture of one of
      her lovers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' exclaimed Mrs. Crawford in a shocked way, forgetting for the moment
      that they were talking on Art. Then she recollected herself and added
      apologetically, 'They were dreadful young women, you know, dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Marvellous passion there is in that face,' continued the young man. 'It
      contains a lifetime of thought&mdash;of suffering. It is a poem&mdash;it
      is a precious composition of intricate harmonies.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Intricate! I should think it is,' said Harwood to Lottie, in the distant
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush!' cried the girl, 'the high-priest is beginning to speak.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The picture is perhaps the only one in existence that may be said to be
      the direct result of the three arts as they are termed, though we prefer
      to think that there is not the least distinction between the methods of
      painting, poetry, and music,' said Mr. Glaston. 'I chanced to drop in to
      the studio of my friend who painted this, and I found him in a sad state
      of despondency. He had nearly all of the details of the picture filled in;
      the figure was as perfect as it is at present&mdash;all except the
      expression of the face. &ldquo;I have been thinking about it for days,&rdquo; said the
      poor fellow, and I could see that his face was haggard with suffering;
      &ldquo;but only now and again has the expression I want passed across my mind,
      and I have been unable to catch it.&rdquo; I looked at the unfinished picture,'
      continued Mr. Glaston, 'and I saw what he wanted. I stood before the
      picture in silence for some time, and then I composed and repeated a
      sonnet which I fancied contained the missing expression of passion. He
      sprang up and seized my hand, and his face brightened with happiness: I
      had given him the absent idea, and I left him painting enthusiastically. A
      few days after, however, I got a line from him entreating me to come to
      him. I was by his side in an hour, and I found him in his former state of
      despondency. &ldquo;It has passed away again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I want you to
      repeat your sonnet.&rdquo; Unfortunately I had forgotten every line of the
      sonnet, and when I told him so he was in agony. But I begged of him not to
      despair. I brought the picture and placed it before me on a piano. I
      looked at it and composed an impromptu that I thought suggested the exact
      passion he wanted for the face. The painter stood listening with his head
      bowed down to his hands. When I ended he caught up the picture. &ldquo;I see it
      all clearly,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you have saved me&mdash;you have saved the
      picture.&rdquo; Two days afterwards he sent it to me finished as it is now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wonderful! is it not, Daireen?' said Mrs. Crawford, as the girl turned
      away after a little pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The face,' said Daireen gently; 'I don't want ever to see it again. Let
      us look at something else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned away to the next picture; but Markham, who had been observing
      the girl's face, and had noticed that little shudder come over her, felt
      strangely interested in the painting, whatever it might be, that had
      produced such an impression upon her. He determined to go unobserved over
      to the window where the work was hanging so soon as everyone would have
      left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It requires real cleverness to compose such a story as that of Mr.
      Glaston's,' said Lottie Vincent to Mr. Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It sounded to me all along like a clever bit of satire, and I daresay it
      was told to him as such,' said Harwood. 'It only needed him to complete
      the nonsense by introducing another of the fine arts in the working out of
      that wonderfully volatile expression.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which is that?' said Lottie; 'do tell me, like a good fellow,' and she
      laid the persuasive finger of a four-buttoned glove upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly. I will finish the story for you,' said Harwood, giving the
      least little imitation of the lordly manner of Mr. Glaston. 'Yes, my
      friend the painter sent a telegram to me a few years after I had performed
      that impromptu, and I was by his side in an hour. I found him at least
      twenty years older in appearance, and he was searching with a lighted
      candle in every corner of the studio for that expression of passion which
      had once more disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I do? I had exhausted the auxiliaries of poetry and music, but
      fortunately another art remained to me; you have heard of the poetry of
      motion? In an instant I had mounted the table and had gone through a
      breakdown of the most æsthetic design, when I saw his face lighten&mdash;his
      grey hairs turned once more to black&mdash;long artistic oily black. &ldquo;I
      have found it,&rdquo; he cried, seizing the hearthbrush and dipping it into the
      paint just as I completed the final attitude: it was found&mdash;but&mdash;what
      is the matter, Miss Vincent?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look!' she whispered. 'Look at Mr. Markham.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens!' cried Harwood, starting up, 'is he going to fall? No, he
      has steadied himself by the window. I thought he was beside us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He went over to the picture a second ago, and I saw that pallor come over
      him,' said Lottie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harwood hastened to where Oswin Markham was standing, his white face
      turned away from the picture, and his hand clutching the rail of a
      curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is the matter, Markham?' said Harwood quietly. 'Are you faint?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Markham turned his eyes upon him with a startled expression, and a smile
      that was not a smile came upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Faint? yes,' he said. 'This room after the air. I'll be all right. Don't
      make a scene, for God's sake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is no need,' said Harwood. 'Sit down here, and I'll get you a glass
      of brandy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not here,' said Markham, giving the least little side glance towards the
      picture. 'Not here, but at the open window.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Harwood helped him over to the open window, and he fell into a seat beside
      it and gazed out at the lawn-tennis players, quite regardless of Lottie
      Vincent standing beside him and enquiring how he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Harwood returned with some brandy in a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thanks, my dear fellow,' said the other, drinking it off eagerly. 'I feel
      better now&mdash;all right, in fact.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This, of course, you perceive,' came the voice of Mr. Glaston from the
      group who were engrossed over the wonders of the final picture,&mdash;'This
      is an exquisite example of a powerful mind endeavouring to subdue the
      agony of memory. Observe the symbolism of the grapes and vine leaves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the warm sunset light outside the band played on, and Miss Vincent
      flitted from group to group with the news that this Mr. Markham had added
      to the romance which was already associated with his name, by fainting in
      the room with the pictures. She was considerably surprised and mortified
      to see him walking with Miss Gerald to the colonel's carriage in half an
      hour afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I assure you,' she said to some one who was laughing at her,&mdash;'I
      assure you I saw him fall against the window at the side of one of the
      pictures. If he was not in earnest, he will make our theatricals a great
      success, for he must be a splendid actor.'

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LL was not well
      with Mr. Standish MacDermot in these days. He was still a guest at that
      pleasant little Dutch cottage of Colonel Gerald's at Mowbray, and he
      received invitations daily to wherever Daireen and her father were going.
      This was certainly all that he could have expected to make him feel at
      ease in the strange land; but somehow he did not feel at ease. He made
      himself extremely pleasant everywhere he went, and he was soon a general
      favourite, though perhaps the few words Mrs. Crawford now and again let
      fall on the subject of his parentage had as large an influence as his own
      natural charm of manner in making the young Irishman popular. Ireland was
      a curious place most of the people at the Cape thought. They had heard of
      its rebellions and of its secret societies, and they had thus formed an
      idea that the island was something like a British colony of which the
      aborigines had hardly been subdued. The impression that Standish was the
      son of one of the kings of the land, who, like the Indian maharajahs, they
      believed, were allowed a certain revenue and had their titles acknowledged
      by the British Government, was very general; and Standish had certainly
      nothing to complain of as to his treatment. But still all was not well
      with Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had received a letter from his father a week after his arrival
      imploring him to return to the land of his sires, for The MacDermot had
      learned from the ancient bard O'Brian, in whom the young man had confided,
      that Standish's destination was the Cape, and so he had been able to write
      to some address. The MacDermot promised to extend his forgiveness to his
      son, and to withdraw his threat of disinheritance, if he would return; and
      he concluded his letter by drawing a picture of the desolation of the
      neighbourhood owing to the English projectors of a railway and a tourists'
      hotel having sent a number of surveyors to the very woods of Innishdermot
      to measure and plan and form all sorts of evil intentions about the
      region. Under these trying circumstances, The Mac-Dermot implored his son
      to grant him the consolation of his society once more. What was still more
      surprising to Standish was the enclosure in the letter of an order for a
      considerable sum of money, for he fancied that his father had previously
      exhausted every available system of leverage for the raising of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though it was very sad for Standish to hear of the old man sitting
      desolate beside the lonely hearth of Innishdermot castle, he made up his
      mind not to return to his home. He had set out to work in the world, and
      he would work, he said. He would break loose from this pleasant life he
      was at present leading, and he would work. Every night he made this
      resolution, though as yet the concrete form of the thought as to what sort
      of work he meant to set about had not suggested itself. He would work
      nobly and manfully for her, he swore, and he would never tell her of his
      love until he could lay his work at her feet and tell her that it had been
      done all for her. Meantime he had gone to that garden party at Government
      House and to several other entertainments, while nearly every day he had
      been riding by the side of Daireen over The Flats or along the beautiful
      road to Wynberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time that Standish was resolving not to open his lips in an
      endeavour to express to Daireen all that was in his heart, another man was
      beginning to feel that it would be necessary to take some step to reveal
      himself to the girl. Arthur Harwood had been analyzing his own heart every
      day since he had gazed out to the far still ocean from the mountain above
      Funchal with Daireen beside him, and now he fancied he knew every thought
      that was in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that he had been obliged to deny himself in his youth the luxury
      of love. He had been working himself up to his present position by his own
      industry and the use of the brains that he felt must be his capital in
      life, and he knew he dared not even think of falling in love. But, when he
      had passed the age of thirty and had made a name and a place for himself
      in the world, he was aware that he might let his affections go fetterless;
      but, alas, it seemed that they had been for too long in slavery: they
      refused to taste the sweets of freedom, and it appeared that his nature
      had become hard and unsympathetic. But it was neither, he knew in his own
      soul, only he had been standing out of the world of softness and of
      sympathy, and had built up for himself unconsciously an ideal whose
      elements were various and indefinable, his imagination only making it a
      necessity that not one of these elements of his ideal should be possible
      to be found in the nature of any of the women with whom he was acquainted
      and whom he had studied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had come to know Daireen Gerald&mdash;and he fancied he had come
      to know her&mdash;he felt that he was no longer shut out from the world of
      love with his cold ideal. He had thought of her day by day aboard the
      steamer as he had thought of no girl hitherto in his life, and he had
      waited for her to think of him and to become conscious that he loved her.
      Considering that one of the most important elements of his vague ideal was
      a complete and absolute unconsciousness of any passion, it was scarcely
      consistent for him now to expect that Daireen should ever perceive the
      feeling of his secret heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, however, made up his mind to remain at the Cape instead of going
      on to the Castaway Islands; and he had written long and interesting
      letters to the newspaper which he represented, on the subject of the
      attitude of the Kafir chief who, he heard, had been taking an attitude.
      Then he had had several opportunities of riding the horse that Colonel
      Gerald had placed at his disposal; but though he had walked and conversed
      frequently with the daughter of Colonel Gerald, he felt that it would be
      necessary for him to speak more directly what he at least fancied was in
      his heart; so that while poor Standish was swearing every night to keep
      his secret, Mr. Harwood was thinking by what means he could contrive to
      reveal himself and find out what were the girl's feelings with regard to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the firmness of his resolution Standish was one afternoon, a few days
      after the garden party, by the side of Daireen on the furthest extremity
      of The Flats, where there was a small wood of pines growing in a sandy
      soil of a glittering whiteness. They pulled up their horses here amongst
      the trees, and Daireen looked out at the white plain beyond; but poor
      Standish could only gaze upon her wistful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I like it,' she said musingly. 'I like that snow. Don't you think it is
      snow, Standish?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is exactly the same,' he answered. 'I can feel a chill pass over me as
      I look upon it. I hate it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' cried the girl, 'don't say that when I have said I like it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should that matter?' he said sternly, for he was feeling his
      resolution very strong within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. 'Why, indeed? Well, hate it as much as you wish, Standish, it
      won't interfere with my loving it, and thinking of how I used to enjoy the
      white winters at home. Then, you know, I used to be thinking of places
      like this&mdash;places with plants like those aloes that the sun is
      glittering over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And why I hate it,' said Standish, 'is because it puts me in mind of the
      many wretched winters I spent in the miserable idleness of my home. While
      others were allowed some chance of making their way in the world&mdash;making
      names for themselves&mdash;there was I shut up in that gaol. I have lost
      every chance I might have had&mdash;everyone is before me in the race.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In what race, Standish? In the race for fame?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, for fame,' cried Standish; 'not that I value fame for its own sake,'
      he added. 'No, I don't covet it, except that&mdash;Daireen, I think there
      is nothing left for me in the world&mdash;I am shut out from every chance
      of reaching anything. I was wretched at home, but I feel even more
      wretched here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should you do that, Standish?' she asked, turning her eyes upon him.
      'I am sure everyone here is very kind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want their kindness, Daireen; it is their kindness that makes me
      feel an impostor. What right have I to receive their kindness? Yes, I had
      better take my father's advice and return by next mail. I am useless in
      the world&mdash;it doesn't want me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't talk so stupidly&mdash;so wickedly,' said the girl gravely. 'You
      are not a coward to set out in the world and turn back discouraged even
      before you have got anything to discourage you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am no coward,' he said; 'but everything has been too hard for me. I am
      a fool&mdash;a wretched fool to have set my heart&mdash;my soul, upon an
      object I can never reach.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean, Standish? You haven't set your heart upon anything that
      you may not gain in time. You will, I know, if you have courage, gain a
      good and noble name for yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of what use would it be to me, Daireen? It would only be a mockery to me&mdash;a
      bitter mockery unless&mdash;Oh, Daireen, it must come, you have forced it
      from me&mdash;I will tell you and then leave you for ever&mdash;Daireen, I
      don't care for anything in the world but to have you love me&mdash;a
      little, Daireen. What would a great name be to me unless&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush, Standish,' said the girl with her face flushed and almost angry.
      'Do not ever speak to me like this again. Why should all our good
      friendship come to an end?' She had softened towards the close of her
      sentence, and she was now looking at him in tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have forced me to speak,' he said. 'God knows how I have struggled to
      hold my secret deep down in my heart&mdash;how I have sworn to hold it,
      but it forced itself out&mdash;we are not masters of ourselves, Daireen.
      Now tell me to leave you&mdash;I am prepared for it, for my dream, I knew,
      was bound to vanish at a touch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Considering that I am four miles from home and in a wood, I cannot tell
      you to do that,' she said with a laugh, for all her anger had been driven
      away. 'Besides that, I like you far too well to turn you away; but,
      Standish, you must never talk so to me again. Now, let us return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know I must not, because I am a beggar,' he said almost madly. 'You
      will love some one who has had a chance of making a name for himself in
      the world. I have had no chance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Standish, I am waiting for you to return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I have seen them sitting beside you aboard the steamer,' continued
      Standish bitterly, 'and I knew well how it would be.' He looked at her
      almost fiercely. 'Yes, I knew it&mdash;you have loved one of them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen's face flushed fearfully and then became deathly pale as she
      looked at him. She did not utter a word, but looked into his face steadily
      with an expression he had never before seen upon hers. He became
      frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Daireen&mdash;dearest Daireen, forgive me,' he cried. I am a fool&mdash;no,
      worse&mdash;I don't know what I say. Daireen, pity me and forgive me.
      Don't look at me that way, for God's sake. Speak to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come away,' she said gently. 'Come away, Standish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But tell me you forgive me, Daireen,' he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come away,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her horse's head towards the track which was made through that
      fine white sand and went on from amongst the pines. He followed her with a
      troubled mind, and they rode side by side over the long flats of heath
      until they had almost reached the lane of cactus leading to Mowbray. In a
      few minutes they would be at the Dutch cottage, and yet they had not
      interchanged a word. Standish could not endure the silence any longer. He
      pulled up his horse suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Daireen,' he said. 'I have been a fool&mdash;a wicked fool, to talk to
      you as I did. I cannot go on until you say you forgive me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned round and smiled on him, holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are very foolish, Standish,' she said. 'We are both very foolish. Why
      should I think anything of what you said? We are still good friends,
      Standish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God bless you!' he cried, seizing her hand fervently. 'I will not make
      myself a fool again.' 'And I,' said the girl, 'I will not be a fool
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So they rode back together. But though Standish had received forgiveness
      he was by no means satisfied with the girl's manner. There was an
      expression that he could not easily read in that smile she had given him.
      He had meant to be very bitter towards her, but had not expected her to
      place him in a position requiring forgiveness. She had forgiven him, it
      was true, but then that smile of hers&mdash;what was that sad wistful
      expression upon her face? He could not tell, but he felt that on the whole
      he had not gained much by the resolutions he had made night after night.
      He was inclined to be dissatisfied with the result of his morning's ride,
      nor was this feeling perceptibly decreased by seeing beneath one of the
      broad-leaved trees that surrounded the cottage the figure of Mr. Arthur
      Harwood by the side of Colonel Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harwood came forward as Daireen reined up on the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have come to say good-bye to you,' he said, looking up to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-bye?' she answered. 'Why, you haven't said good-morning yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood was a clever man and he knew it; but his faculty for reading
      what was passing in another person's mind did not bring him happiness
      always. He had made use of what he meant to be a test sentence to Daireen,
      and the result of his observation of its effect was not wholly pleasant to
      him. He had hoped for a little flush&mdash;a little trembling of the hand,
      but neither had come; a smile was on her face, and the pulses of the hand
      she held out to him were unruffled. He knew then that the time had not yet
      come for him to reveal himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should you say good-bye?' she asked after she had greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, perhaps I should only say <i>au revoir</i>, though, upon my word,
      the state of the colony is becoming so critical that one going up country
      should always say good-bye. Yes, my duties call me to leave all this
      pleasant society, Miss Gerald. I am going among the Zulus for a while.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have every confidence in you, Mr. Harwood,' she said. 'You will return
      in safety. We will miss you greatly, but I know how much the people at
      home will be benefited by hearing the result of your visit; so we resign
      ourselves to your absence. But indeed we shall miss you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And if a treacherous assegai should transfix me, I trust my fate will
      draw a single tear,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh as Daireen rode round to dismount and Harwood went in to
      lunch. It was very pleasant chat he felt, but he was as much dissatisfied
      with her laugh as Standish had been with her smile.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE very
      pleasantness of the lunch Harwood had at the Dutch cottage made his visit
      seem more unsatisfactory to him. He had come up to the girl with that
      sentence which should surely have sounded pathetic even though spoken with
      indifference. He was beside her to say good-bye. He had given her to
      understand that he was going amongst the dangers of a disturbed part of
      the country, but the name of the barbarous nation had not made her cheek
      pale. It was well enough for himself to make light of his adventurous
      undertaking, but he did not think that her smiles in telling him that she
      would miss him were altogether becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, as he rode towards Cape Town he felt that the time had not yet come
      for him to reveal himself to Daireen Gerald. He would have to be patient,
      as he had been for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far he had found out negatively how Daireen felt towards himself: she
      liked him, he knew, but only as most women liked him, because he could
      tell them in an agreeable way things that they wanted to know&mdash;because
      he had travelled everywhere and had become distinguished. He was not a
      conceited man, but he knew exactly how he stood in the estimation of
      people, and it was bitter for him to reflect that he did not stand
      differently with regard to Miss Gerald. But he had not attempted to
      discover what were Daireen's feelings respecting any one else. He was well
      aware that Mrs. Crawford was anxious to throw Mr. Glaston in the way of
      the girl as much as possible; but he felt that it would take a long time
      for Mr. Glaston to make up his mind to sacrifice himself at Daireen's
      feet, and Daireen was far too sensible to be imposed upon by his artistic
      flourishes. As for this young Mr. Standish Macnamara, Harwood saw at once
      that Daireen regarded him with a friendliness that precluded the
      possibility of love, so he did not fear the occupation of the girl's heart
      by Standish. But when Harwood began to think of Oswin Markham&mdash;he
      heard the sound of a horse's hoofs behind him, and Oswin Markham himself
      trotted up, looking dusty and fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I should know your animal,&rdquo; said Markham, &ldquo;and I made an effort
      to overtake you, though I meant to go easily into the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harwood looked at him and then at his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem as if you owed yourself a little ease,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must have
      done a good deal in the way of riding, judging from your appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal too much,&rdquo; replied Markham. &ldquo;I have been on the saddle since
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been out every morning for the past three days before I have
      left my room. I was quite surprised when I heard it, after the evidence
      you gave at the garden party of your weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my weakness, yes,&rdquo; said Markham, with a little laugh. &ldquo;It was
      wretchedly weak to allow myself to be affected by the change from the open
      air to that room, but it felt stifling to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't feel the difference to be anything considerable,&rdquo; said Harwood;
      &ldquo;so the fact of your being overcome by it proves that you are not in a fit
      state to be playing with your constitution. Where did you ride to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Upon my word I have not the remotest idea,&rdquo; said Markham. &ldquo;I took
      the road out to Simon's Bay, but I pulled up at a beach on the nearer side
      of it, and remained there for a good while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be worse than riding about in this aimless sort of way.
      Here you are completely knocked up now, as you have been for the past
      three evenings. Upon my word, you seem indifferent as to whether or not
      you ever leave the colony alive. You are simply trifling with yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, I suppose,&rdquo; said Markham wearily. &ldquo;But what is a fellow to
      do in Cape Town? One can't remain inactive beyond a certain time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only within the past three days you have taken up this roving
      notion,&rdquo; said Harwood. &ldquo;It is in fact only since that Government House
      affair.&rdquo; Markham turned and looked at him eagerly for a moment. &ldquo;Yes,
      since your weakness became apparent to yourself, you have seemed bound to
      prove your strength to the furthest. But you are pushing it too far, my
      boy. You'll find out your mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; laughed the other. &ldquo;Perhaps so. By the way, is it true that
      you are going up country, Harwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true. The fact is that affairs are becoming critical with regard to
      our relations with the Zulus, and unless I am greatly mistaken, this
      colony will be the centre of interest before many months have passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing I should like better than to go up with you, Harwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harwood shook his head. &ldquo;You are not strong enough, my boy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause before Markham said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not strong enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they rode into Cape Town together, and dismounted at their hotel;
      and, certainly, as he walked up the stairs to his room, Oswin Markham
      looked anything but strong enough to undertake a journey into the Veldt.
      Doctor Campion would probably have spoken unkindly to him had he seen him
      now, haggard and weary, with his day spent on an exposed road beneath a
      hot sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is anything but strong enough,&rdquo; said Harwood to himself as he watched
      the other man; and then he recollected the tone in which Markham had
      repeated those words, &ldquo;I am not strong enough.&rdquo; Was it possible, he asked
      himself, that Markham meant that his strength of purpose was not
      sufficiently great? He thought over this question for some time, and the
      result of his reflection was to make him wish that he had not thought the
      conduct of that defiant chief of such importance as demanded the personal
      observation of the representative of the <i>Dominant Trumpeter</i>. He
      felt that he would like to search out the origin of the weakness of Mr.
      Oswin Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the time these people were thinking their thoughts and making
      their resolutions upon various subjects, Mr. Algernon Glaston was
      remaining in the settled calm of artistic rectitude. He was awaiting with
      patience the arrival of his father from the Salamander Archipelago, though
      he had given the prelate of that interesting group to understand that
      circumstances would render it impossible for his son to remain longer than
      a certain period at the Cape, so that if he desired the communion of his
      society it would be necessary to allow the mission work among the
      Salamanders to take care of itself. For Mr. Glaston was by no means
      unaware of the sacrifice he was in the habit of making annually for the
      sake of passing a few weeks with his father in a country far removed from
      all artistic centres. The Bishop of the Calapash Islands and Metropolitan
      of the Salamander Archipelago had it several times urged upon him that his
      son was a marvel of filial duty for undertaking this annual journey, so
      that he, no doubt, felt convinced of the fact; and though this visit added
      materially to the expenses of his son's mode of life, which, of course,
      were defrayed by the bishop, yet the bishop felt that this addition was,
      after all, trifling compared with the value of the sentiment of filial
      affection embodied in the annual visit to the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Glaston had allowed his father a margin of three weeks for any
      impediments that might arise to prevent his leaving the Salamanders, but a
      longer space he could not, he assured his father, remain awaiting his
      arrival from the sunny islands of his see. Meantime he was dining out
      night after night with his friends at the Cape, and taking daily drives
      and horse-exercise for the benefit of his health. Upon the evening when
      Harwood and Markham entered the hotel together, Mr. Glaston was just
      departing to join a dinner-party which was to assemble at the house of a
      certain judge, and as Harwood was also to be a guest, he was compelled to
      dress hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswin Markham was not, however, aware of the existence of the hospitable
      judge, so he remained in the hotel. He was tired almost to a point of
      prostration after his long aimless ride, but a bath and a dinner revived
      him, and after drinking his coffee he threw himself upon a sofa and slept
      for some hours. When he awoke it was dark, and then lighting a cigar he
      went out to the balcony that ran along the upper windows, and seated
      himself in the cool air that came landwards from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched the soldiers in white uniform crossing the square; he saw the
      Malay population who had been making a holiday, returning to their quarter
      of the town, the men with their broad conical straw hats, the women with
      marvellously coloured shawls; he saw the coolies carrying their burdens,
      and the Hottentots and the Kafirs and all the races blended in the motley
      population of Cape Town. He glanced listlessly at all, thinking his own
      thoughts undisturbed by any incongruity of tongues or of races beneath
      him, and he was only awakened from the reverie into which he had fallen by
      the opening of one of the windows near him and the appearance on the
      balcony of Algernon Glaston in his dinner dress and smoking a choice
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The generous wine of the generous judge had made Mr. Glaston particularly
      courteous, for he drew his chair almost by the side of Markham's and
      inquired after his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harwood was at that place to-night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he mentioned that you
      were killing yourself. Just like these newspaper fellows to exaggerate
      fearfully for the sake of making a sensation. You are all right now, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Markham. &ldquo;I don't feel exactly like an elephant for
      vigour, but you know what it is to feel strong without having any
      particular strength. I am that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadfully brutal people I met to-night,&rdquo; continued Mr. Glaston
      reflectively. &ldquo;Sort of people Harwood could get on with. Talking actually
      about some wretched savage&mdash;some Zulu chief or other from whom they
      expect great things; as if the action of a ruffianly barbarian could
      affect any one. It was quite disgusting talk. I certainly would have come
      away at once only I was lucky enough to get by the side of a girl who
      seems to know something of Art&mdash;a Miss Vincent&mdash;she is quite
      fresh and enthusiastic on the subject&mdash;quite a child indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Markham thought it prudent to light a fresh cigar from the end of the one
      he had smoked, at the interval left by Mr. Glaston for his comment, so
      that a vague &ldquo;indeed&rdquo; was all that came through his closed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she seems rather a tractable sort of little thing. By the way, she
      mentioned something about your having become faint at Government House the
      other day, before you had seen all my pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Markham. &ldquo;The change from the open air to that room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, of course. Miss Vincent seems to understand something of the meaning
      of the pictures. She was particularly interested in one of them, which,
      curiously enough, is the most wonderful of the collection. Did you study
      them all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not all; the fact was, that unfortunate weakness of mine interfered
      with my scrutiny,&rdquo; said Markham. &ldquo;But the single glance I had at one of
      the pictures convinced me that it was a most unusual work. I felt greatly
      interested in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the Aholibah, no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard your description of how if came to be painted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but that referred only to the marvellous expression of the face&mdash;so
      saturate&mdash;so devoured&mdash;with passion. You saw how Miss Gerald
      turned away from it with a shudder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did she do that?&rdquo; said Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; said Glaston, with a little sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; said Markham, after a pause and without any sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could not understand it,&rdquo; continued Glaston. &ldquo;All that that face
      means cannot be apprehended in a glance. It has a significance of its own&mdash;it
      is a symbol of a passion that withers like a fire&mdash;a passion that can
      destroy utterly all the beauty of a life that might have been intense with
      beauty. You are not going away, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Markham had risen from his seat and turned away his head, grasping the
      rail of the balcony. It was some moments before he started and looked
      round at the other man. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'm not going away,
      I am greatly interested. Yes, I caught a glimpse of the expression of the
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a miracle of power,&rdquo; continued Glaston. &ldquo;Miss Gerald felt, but she
      could not understand why she should feel, its power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, during which Markham stared blankly across the
      square, and the other leant back in his chair and watched the curling of
      his cigar clouds through the still air. From the garrison at the castle
      there came to them the sound of a bugle-call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am greatly interested in that picture,&rdquo; said Markham at length. &ldquo;I
      should like to know all the details of its working out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The expression of the face&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I know all of that. I mean the scene&mdash;that hill seen through the
      arch&mdash;the pavement of the oriental apartment&mdash;the&mdash;the
      figure&mdash;how did the painter bring them together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is of little consequence in the study of the elements of the
      symbolism,&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course it is; but still I should like to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really never thought of putting any question to the painter about these
      matters,&rdquo; replied Glaston. &ldquo;He had travelled in the East, and the kiosk
      was amongst his sketches; as for the model of the figure, if I do not
      mistake, I saw the study for the face in an old portfolio of his he
      brought from Sicily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these are mere accidents in the production of the picture. The
      symbolism is the picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause, and the chatter of a couple of Malays in the
      street became louder, and then fainter, as the speakers drew near and
      passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glaston,&rdquo; said Markham at length, &ldquo;did you remove the pictures from
      Government House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in one of my rooms,&rdquo; said Glaston. &ldquo;Would you think it a piece
      of idle curiosity if I were to step upstairs and take a look at that
      particular work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not see it by lamplight. You can study them all in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I feel in the mood just now, and you know how much depends upon the
      mood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My room is open,&rdquo; said Glaston. &ldquo;But the idea that has possessed you is
      absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say, I dare say, but I have become interested in all that you have
      told me; I must try and&mdash;and understand the symbolism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the balcony before Mr. Glaston had made up his mind as to whether
      there was a touch of sarcasm in his voice uttering the final sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not worse than the rest of the uneducated world,&rdquo; murmured the Art
      prophet condescendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in Mr. Glaston's private room upstairs Oswin Markham was standing
      holding a lighted lamp up to that interesting picture and before that
      wonderful symbolic expression upon the face of the figure; the rest of the
      room was in darkness. He looked up to the face that the lamplight gloated
      over. The remainder of the picture was full of reflections of the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A power that can destroy utterly all the beauty of a life,&rdquo; he said,
      repeating the analysis of Mr. Glaston. He continued looking at it before
      he repeated another of that gentleman's sentences&mdash;&ldquo;She felt, but
      could not understand, its power.&rdquo; He laid the lamp on the table and walked
      over to the darkened window and gazed out. But once more he returned to
      the picture. &ldquo;A passion that can destroy utterly all the beauty of life,&rdquo;
       he said again. &ldquo;Utterly! that is a lie!&rdquo; He remained with his eyes upon
      the picture for some moments, then he lifted the lamp and went to the
      door. At the door he stopped, glanced at the picture and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Volsunga Saga there is an account of how a jealous woman listens
      outside the chamber where a man whom she once loved is being murdered in
      his wife's arms; hearing the cry of the wife in the chamber the woman at
      the door laughs. A man beside her says, &ldquo;Thou dost not laugh because thy
      heart is made glad, or why moves that pallor upon thy face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswin Markham left the room and thanked Mr. Glaston for having gratified
      his whim.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE long level rays
      of the sun that was setting in crimson splendour were touching the bright
      leaves of the silver-fir grove on one side of the ravine traversing the
      slope of the great peaked hill which makes the highest point of Table
      Mountain, but the other side was shadowy. The flat face of the precipice
      beneath the long ridge of the mountain was full of fantastic gleams of red
      in its many crevices, and far away a thin waterfall seemed a shimmering
      band of satin floating downwards through a dark bed of rocks. Table Bay
      was lying silent and with hardly' a sparkle upon its ripples from where
      the outline of Robbin Island was seen at one arm of its crescent to the
      white sand of the opposite shore. The vineyards of the lower slope,
      beneath which the red road crawled, were dim and colourless, for the
      sunset bands had passed away from them and flared only upon the higher
      slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the summit of the ridge of the silver-fir ravine Daireen Gerald sat
      looking out to where the sun was losing itself among the ridges of the
      distant kloof, and at her feet was Oswin Markham. Behind them rose the
      rocks of the Peak with their dark green herbage. Beneath them the soft
      rustle of a songless bird was heard through the foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it remains to be told how those two persons came to be watching
      together the phenomenon of sunset from the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Crawford who had upon the very day after the departure of
      Arthur Harwood organised one of those little luncheon parties which are so
      easily organised and give promise of pleasures so abundant. She had
      expressed to Mr. Harwood the grief she felt at his being compelled by duty
      to depart from the midst of their circle, just as she had said to Mr.
      Markham how bowed down she had been at the reflection of his leaving the
      steamer at St. Helena; and Harwood had thanked her for her kind
      expressions, and made a mental resolve that he would say something
      sarcastic regarding the Army Boot Commission in his next communication to
      the <i>Dominant Trumpeter</i>. But the hearing of the gun of the mail
      steamer that was to convey the special correspondent to Natal was the
      pleasantest sensation Mrs. Crawford had experienced for long. She had been
      very anxious on Harwood's account for some time. She did not by any means
      think highly of the arrangement which had been made by Colonel Gerald to
      secure for one of his horses an amount of exercise by allowing Mr. Harwood
      to ride it; for she was well aware that Mr. Harwood would think it quite
      within the line of his duty to exercise the animal at times when Miss
      Gerald would be riding out. She knew that most girls liked Mr. Harwood,
      and whatever might be Mr. Harwood's feelings towards the race that so
      complimented him, she could not doubt that he admired to a perilous point
      the daughter of Colonel Gerald. If, then, the girl would return his
      feeling, what would become of Mrs. Crawford's hopes for Mr. Glaston?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the constant reflection upon this question that caused the sound of
      the mail gun to fall gratefully upon the ears of the major's wife. Harwood
      was to be away for more than a month at any rate, and in a month much
      might be accomplished, not merely by a special correspondent, but by a
      lady with a resolute mind and a strategical training. So she had set her
      mind to work, and without delay had organised what gave promise of being a
      delightful little lunch, issuing half a dozen invitations only three days
      in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Algernon Glaston had, after some persuasion, promised to join the
      party. Colonel Gerald and his daughter expressed the happiness they would
      have at being present, and Mr. Standish Macnamara felt certain that
      nothing could interfere with his delight. Then there were the two
      daughters of a member of the Legislative Council who were reported to look
      with fond eyes upon the son of one of the justices of the Supreme Court, a
      young gentleman who was also invited. Lastly, by what Mrs. Crawford
      considered a stroke of real constructive ability, Mr. Oswin Markham and
      Miss Lottie Vincent were also begged to allow themselves to be added to
      the number of the party. Mrs. Crawford disliked Lottie, but that was no
      reason why Lottie should not exercise the tactics Mrs. Crawford knew she
      possessed, to take care of Mr. Oswin Markham for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would have much to talk about regarding the projected dramatic
      entertainment of the young lady, so that Mr. Glaston should be left
      solitary in that delightful listless after-space of lunch, unless indeed&mdash;and
      the contingency was, it must be confessed, suggested to the lady&mdash;Miss
      Gerald might chance to remain behind the rest of the party; in that case
      it would not seem beyond the bounds of possibility that the weight of Mr.
      Glaston's loneliness would be endurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything had been carried out with that perfect skill which can be
      gained only by experience. The party had driven from Mowbray for a
      considerable way up the hill. The hampers had been unpacked and the lunch
      partaken of in a shady nook which was supposed to be free from the
      venomous reptiles that make picnics somewhat risky enjoyments in sunny
      lands; and then the young people had trooped away to gather Venus-hair
      ferns at the waterfall, or silver leaves from the grove, or bronze-green
      lizards, or some others of the offspring of nature which have come into
      existence solely to meet the requirements of collectors. Mr. Glaston and
      Daireen followed more leisurely, and Mrs. Crawford's heart was happy. The
      sun would be setting in an hour, she reflected, and she had great
      confidence in the effect of fine sunsets upon the hearts of lovers&mdash;.
      nay, upon the raw material that might after a time develop into the hearts
      of lovers. She was quite satisfied seeing the young people depart, for she
      was not aware how much more pleasant than Oswin Markham Lottie Vincent had
      found Mr. Glaston at that judge's dinner-party a few evenings previous,
      nor how much more plastic than Miss Gerald Mr. Glaston had found Lottie
      Vincent upon the same occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford did not think it possible that Lottie could be so clever,
      even if she had had the inclination, as to effect the separation of the
      party as it had been arranged. But Lottie had by a little manouvre waited
      at the head of the ravine until Mr. Glaston and Daireen had come up, and
      then she had got into conversation with Mr. Glaston upon a subject that
      was a blank to the others, so that they had walked quietly on together
      until that pleasant space at the head of the ravine was reached. There
      Daireen had seated herself to watch the west become crimson with sunset,
      and at her feet Oswin had cast himself to watch her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Mrs. Crawford been aware of this, she would scarcely perhaps have been
      so pleasant to her friend Colonel Gerald, or to her husband far down on
      the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very silent at the head of that ravine. The delicate splash of the
      water that trickled through the rocks far away was distinctly heard. The
      rosy bands that had been about the edges of the silver leaves had passed
      off. Daireen's face was at last left in shadow, and she turned to watch
      the rays move upwards, until soon only the dark Peak was enwound in the
      red light that made its forehead like the brows of an ancient Bacchanal
      encircled with a rose-wreath. Then quickly the red dwindled away, until
      only a single rose-leaf was upon the highest point; an instant more and it
      had passed, leaving the hill dark and grim in outline against the pale
      blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then succeeded that time of silent conflict between light and darkness&mdash;a
      time of silence and of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the slope of the Peak it was silent enough. The girl's eyes went out
      across the shadowy plain below to where the water was shining in its own
      gray light, but she uttered not a word. The man leant his head upon his
      hand as he looked up to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the 'Ave' you are breathing to the sunset, Miss Gerald?&rdquo; he said
      at length, and she gave a little start and looked at him. &ldquo;What is the
      vesper hymn your heart has been singing all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;No hymn, no song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it upon your face,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I saw its melody in your eyes; and
      yet&mdash;yet I cannot understand it&mdash;I am too gross to be able to
      translate it. I suppose if a man had sensitive hearing the wind upon the
      blades of grass would make good music to him, but most people are dull to
      everything but the rolling of barrels and such-like music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not even a musical thought,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I am afraid that if
      all I thought were translated into words, the result would be a jumble:
      you know what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Heaven is a jumble, isn't it? A bit of wonderful blue here, and a
      shapeless cloud there&mdash;a few faint breaths of music floating about a
      place of green, and an odour of a field of flowers. Yes, all dreams are
      jumbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was dreaming?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, I dare say my confusion of thought
      without a single idea may be called by courtesy a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now have you awakened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreams must break and dissolve some time, I suppose, Mr. Markham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must, they must,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder when will my awaking come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a dream?&rdquo; she asked, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am living one,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living one. My life has become a dream to me. How am I beside you? How is
      it possible that I could be beside you? Either of two things must be a
      dream&mdash;either my past life is a dream, or I am living one in this
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there so vast a difference between them?&rdquo; she asked, looking at him.
      His eyes were turned away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vast? Vast?&rdquo; he repeated musingly. Then he rose to his feet and looked
      out oceanwards. &ldquo;I don't know what is vast,&rdquo; he said. Then he looked down
      to her. &ldquo;Miss Gerald, I don't believe that my recollection of my past is
      in the least correct. My memory is a falsehood utterly. For it is quite
      impossible that this body of mine&mdash;this soul of mine&mdash;could have
      passed through such a change as I must have passed through if my memory
      has got anything of truth in it. My God! my God! The recollections that
      come to me are, I know, impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you, Mr. Markham,&rdquo; said Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he threw himself on the short tawny herbage beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not heard of men being dragged back when they have taken a step
      beyond the barrier that hangs between life and death&mdash;men who have
      had one foot within the territory of death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know it is not the same old life that a man leads when he is
      brought from that dominion of death. He begins life anew. He knows nothing
      of the past. He laughs at the faces that were once familiar to him; they
      mean nothing to him. His past is dead. Think of me, child. Day by day I
      suffered all the agonies of death and hell, and shall I not have granted
      to me that most righteous gift of God? Shall not my past be utterly
      blotted out? Yes, these vague memories that I have are the memories of a
      dream. God has not been so just to me as to others, for there are some
      realities of the past still with me I know, and thus I am at times led to
      think it might be possible that all my recollections are true&mdash;but
      no, it is impossible&mdash;utterly impossible.&rdquo; Again he leapt to his feet
      and clasped his hands over his head. &ldquo;Child&mdash;child, if you knew all,
      you would pity me,&rdquo; he said, in a tone no louder than a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never heard anything so pitiful before. Seeing the agony of the
      man, and hearing him trying to convince himself of that at which his
      reason rebelled, was terribly pitiful to her. She never before that moment
      knew how she felt towards this man to whom she had given life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say of comfort to you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have all the sympathy
      of my heart. Why will you not ask me to help you? What is my pity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt beside her. &ldquo;Be near me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me look at you now. Is
      there not a bond between us?&mdash;such a bond as binds man to his God?
      You gave me my life as a gift, and it will be a true life now. God had no
      pity for me, but you have more than given me your pity. The life you have
      given me is better than the life given me by God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do not think that I have given you anything.
      It is your God who has changed you through those days of terrible
      suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the suffering is God's gift,&rdquo; he cried bitterly. &ldquo;Torture of days
      and nights, and then not utter forgetfulness. After passing through the
      barrier of death, I am denied the blessings that should come with death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you wish to forget anything of the past?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Has
      everything been so very terrible to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible?&rdquo; he said, clasping his hands over one of his knees and gazing
      out to the conflict of purple and shell-pink in the west. &ldquo;No, nothing was
      terrible. I am no Corsair with a hundred romantic crimes to give me so
      much remorseful agony as would enable me to act the part of Count Lara
      with consistency. I am no Lucifer encircled with a halo of splendid
      wickedness. It is only the change that has passed over me since I felt
      myself looking at you that gives me this agony of thought. Wasted time is
      my only sin&mdash;hours cast aside&mdash;years trampled upon. I lived for
      myself as I had a chance&mdash;as thousands of others do, and it did not
      seem to me anything terrible that I should make my father's days miserable
      to him. I did not feel myself to be the curse to him that I now know
      myself to have been. I was a curse to him. He had only myself in the world&mdash;no
      other son, and yet I could leave him to die alone&mdash;yes, and to die
      offering me his forgiveness&mdash;offering it when it was not in my power
      to refuse to accept it. This is the memory that God will not take away.
      Nay, I tell you it seems that instead of being blotted out by my days of
      suffering it is but intensified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had bowed down his face upon his hands as he sat there. Her eyes were
      full of tears of sympathy and compassion&mdash;she felt with him, and his
      sufferings were hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity you&mdash;with all my soul I pity you,&rdquo; she said, laying her hand
      upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and took her hand, holding it not with a fervent grasp; but in
      his face that looked up to her tearful eyes there was a passion of love
      and adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a man looks to his God I look to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Be near me that the
      life you have given me may be good. Let me think of you, and the dead Past
      shall bury its dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What answer could she make to him? The tears continued to come to her eyes
      as she sat while he looked into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;you know I feel for you. You know that I
      understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I am only beginning to understand myself; I
      have never done so in all my life hitherto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they watched the delicate shadowy dimness&mdash;not gray, but full of
      the softest azure&mdash;begin to swathe the world beneath them. The waters
      of the bay were reflecting the darkening sky, and out over the ocean
      horizon a single star was beginning to breathe through the blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;is the bond between us one of love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no passion in his voice, nor was his hand that held hers
      trembling as he spoke. She gave no start at his words, nor did she
      withdraw her hand. Through the silence the splash of the waterfall above
      them was heard clearly. She looked at him through the long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I cannot answer you yet&mdash;&mdash;No, not
      yet&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not ask,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Not yet&mdash;not yet.&rdquo; And he dropped
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose and looked out to that star, which was no longer smothered in
      the splendid blue of the heavens, but was glowing in passion until the
      waters beneath caught some of its rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause before a voice sounded behind them on the slope&mdash;the
      musical voice of Miss Lottie Vincent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such a sentimental couple?&rdquo; she cried, raising her hands
      with a very pretty expression of mock astonishment. &ldquo;Watching the twilight
      as if you were sitting for your portraits, while here we have been
      searching for you over hill and dale. Have we not, Mr. Glaston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Glaston thought it unnecessary to corroborate a statement made with
      such evident ingenuousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your search met with its reward, I hope, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; said Oswin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in finding you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so vain as to fancy it possible that you should accept that as a
      reward, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady gave him a glance that was meant to read his inmost soul.
      Then she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must really hasten back to good Mamma Crawford,&rdquo; she said, with a
      seriousness that seemed more frivolous than her frivolity. &ldquo;Every one will
      be wondering where we have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky that you will be able to tell them,&rdquo; remarked Oswin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; she said quickly, almost apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know you can say 'Over hill, over dale,' and so satisfy even the
      most sceptical in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lottie made a little pause, then laughed again; she did not think it
      necessary to make any reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they all went down by the little track along the edge of the
      ravine, and the great Peak became darker above them as the twilight
      dwindled into evening.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. Crawford was
      not in the least apprehensive of the safety of the young people who had
      been placed under her care upon this day. She had been accustomed in the
      good old days at Arradambad, when the scorching inhabitants had lifted
      their eyes unto the hills, and had fled to their cooling slopes, to
      organise little open-air tiffins for the benefit of such young persons as
      had come out to visit the British Empire in the East under the guidance of
      the major's wife, and the result of her experience went to prove that it
      was quite unnecessary to be in the least degree nervous regarding the
      ultimate welfare of the young persons who were making collections of the
      various products of Nature. It was much better for the young persons to
      learn self-dependence, she thought, and though many of the maidens under
      her care had previously, through long seasons at Continental
      watering-places, become acquainted with a few of the general points to be
      observed in maintaining a course of self-dependence, yet the additional
      help that came to them from the hills was invaluable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Crawford now gave a casual glance round the descending party, she
      felt that her skill as a tactician was not on the wane. They were walking
      together, and though Lottie was of course chatting away as flippantly as
      ever, yet both Markham and Mr. Glaston was very silent, she saw, and her
      conclusions were as rapid as those of an accustomed campaigner should be.
      Mr. Glaston had been talking to Daireen in the twilight, so that Lottie's
      floss-chat was a trouble to him; while Oswin Markham was wearied with
      having listened for nearly an hour to her inanities, and was seeking for
      the respite of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You naughty children, to stray away in that fashion!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Do you
      fancy you had permission to lose yourselves like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did we lose ourselves, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; said Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We certainly did not,&rdquo; said Lottie, and then Mrs. Crawford's first
      suggestions were confirmed: Lottie and Markham spoke of themselves, while
      Daireen and Mr. Glaston were mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very naughty of you,&rdquo; continued the matron. &ldquo;Why, in India, if you
      once dared do such a thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should do it for ever,&rdquo; cried Lottie. &ldquo;Now, you know, my dear good
      Mrs. Crawford, I have been in India, and I have had experience of your
      picnics when we were at the hills&mdash;oh, the most delightful little
      affairs&mdash;every one used to look forward to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford laughed gently as she patted Lottie on the cheek. &ldquo;Ah, they
      were now and again successes, were they not? How I wish Daireen had been
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, she would not be with us now, my dear,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;Eh,
      George, what do you say, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, major,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford, glancing towards Lottie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo; said the bewildered Boot Commissioner, who meant to be very
      gallant indeed. It was some moments before he perceived how Miss Vincent
      could construe his words, and then he attempted an explanation, which made
      matters worse. &ldquo;My dear, I assure you I never meant that your attractions
      were not&mdash;not&mdash;ah&mdash;most attractive, they were, I assure you&mdash;you
      were then most attractive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so far from having waned,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald, &ldquo;it would seem that
      every year has but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what on earth is the meaning of this raid of compliments on poor
      little me?&rdquo; cried the young lady in the most artless manner, glancing from
      the major to the colonel with uplifted hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hasten to the carriages, and leave these old men to talk their
      nonsense to each other,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, putting her arm about one of
      the daughters of the member of the Legislative Council&mdash;a young lady
      who had found the companionship of Standish Macnamara quite as pleasant as
      her sister had the guidance of the judge's son up the ravine&mdash;and so
      they descended to where the carriages were waiting to take them towards
      Cape Town. Daireen and her father were to walk to the Dutch cottage, which
      was but a short distance away, and with them, of course, Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my dear child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, embracing Daireen, while
      the others talked in a group. &ldquo;You are looking pale, dear, but never mind;
      I will drive out and have a long chat with you in a couple of days,&rdquo; she
      whispered, in a way she meant to be particularly impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the carriage went off, and Daireen put her hand through her father's
      arm, and walked silently in the silent evening to the house among the
      aloes and Australian oaks, through whose leaves the fireflies were
      flitting in myriads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a good woman,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald. &ldquo;An exceedingly good woman,
      only her long experience of the sort of girls who used to be sent out to
      her at India has made her rather misjudge the race, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so good,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;Think of all the trouble she was at
      to-day for our sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for our sake,&rdquo; laughed her father. &ldquo;My dear Dolly, if you could only
      know the traditions our old station retains of Mrs. Crawford, you would
      think her doubly good. The trouble she has gone to for the sake of her
      friends&mdash;her importations by every mail&mdash;is simply astonishing.
      But what did you think of that charming Miss Van der Veldt you took such
      care of, Standish, my boy? Did you make much progress in Cape Dutch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Standish could not answer in the same strain of pleasantry. He was
      thinking too earnestly upon the visions his fancy had been conjuring up
      during the entire evening&mdash;visions of Mr. Glaston sitting by the side
      of Daireen gazing out to that seductive, though by no means uncommon,
      phenomenon of sunset. He had often wished, when at the waterfall gathering
      Venus-hair for Miss Van der Veldt, that he could come into possession of
      the power of Joshua at the valley of Gibeon to arrest the descent of the
      orb. The possibly disastrous consequences to the planetary system seemed
      to him but trifling weighed against the advantages that would accrue from
      the fact of Mr. Glaston's being deprived of a source of conversation that
      was both fruitful and poetical. Standish knew well, without having read
      Wordsworth, that the twilight was sovereign of one peaceful hour; he had
      in his mind quite a store of unuttered poetical observations upon sunset,
      and he felt that Mr. Glaston might possibly be possessed of similar
      resources which he could draw upon when occasion demanded such a display.
      The thought of Mr. Glaston sitting at the feet of Daireen, and with her
      drinking in of the glory of the west, was agonising to Standish, and so he
      could not enter into Colonel Gerald's pleasantry regarding the attractive
      daughter of the member of the Legislative Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Daireen had shut the door of her room that night and stood alone in
      the darkness, she found the relief that she had been seeking since she had
      come down from the slope of that great Peak&mdash;relief that could not be
      found even in the presence of her father, who had been everything to her a
      few days before. She found relief in being alone with her thoughts in the
      silence of the night. She drew aside the curtains of her window, and
      looked out up to that Peak which was towering amongst the brilliant stars.
      She could know exactly the spot upon the edge of the ravine where she had
      been sitting&mdash;where they had been sitting. What did it all mean? she
      asked herself. She could not at first recollect any of the words she had
      heard upon that slope, she could not even think what they should mean, but
      she had a childlike consciousness of happiness mixed with fear. What was
      the mystery that had been unfolded to her up there? What was the
      revelation that had been made to her? She could not tell. It seemed
      wonderful to her how she could so often have looked up to that hill
      without feeling anything of what she now felt gazing up to its slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all too wonderful for her to understand. She had a consciousness of
      nothing but that all was wonderful. She could not remember any of his
      words except those he had last uttered. The bond between them&mdash;was it
      of love? How could she tell? What did she know of love? She could not
      answer him when he had spoken to her, nor was she able even now, as she
      stood looking out to those brilliant stars that crowned the Peak and
      studded the dark edges of the slope which had been lately overspread with
      the poppy-petals of sunset. It was long before she went into her bed, but
      she had arrived at no conclusion to her thoughts&mdash;all that had
      happened seemed mysterious; and she knew not whether she felt happy beyond
      all the happiness she had ever known, or sad beyond the sadness of any
      hour of her life. Her sleep swallowed up all her perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the instant she awoke in the bright morning she went softly over to
      the window and looked out from a corner of her blind to that slope and to
      the place where they had sat. No, it was not a dream. There shone the
      silver leaves and there sparkled the waterfall. It was the loveliest hill
      in the world, she felt&mdash;lovelier even than the purple heather-clad
      Slieve Docas. This was a terrible thought to suggest itself to her mind,
      she felt all the time she was dressing, but still it remained with her and
      refused to be shaken off.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>OLONEL Gerald was
      well aware of Mrs. Crawford's strategical skill, and he had watched its
      development and exercise during the afternoon of that pleasant little
      luncheon party on the hill. He remembered what she had said to him so
      gravely at the garden-party at Government House regarding the
      responsibility inseparable from the guardianship of Daireen at the Cape,
      and he knew that Mrs. Crawford had in her mind, when she organised the
      party to the hill, such precepts as she had previously enunciated. He had
      watched and admired her cleverness in arranging the collecting
      expeditions, and he felt that her detaining of Mr. Glaston as she had
      under some pretext until all the others but Daireen had gone up the ravine
      was a master stroke. But at this point Colonel Gerald's observation ended.
      His imagination had been much less vivid than either Mrs. Crawford's or
      Standish's. He did not attribute any subtle influence to the setting sun,
      nor did he conjure up any vision of Mr. Glaston sitting at the feet of
      Daireen and uttering words that the magic of the sunset glories alone
      could inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that he knew much better than either Mrs. Crawford or
      Standish how his daughter felt towards Mr. Glaston, and he was not in the
      least concerned in the result of her observation of the glowing west by
      the side of the Art prophet. When Mrs. Crawford looked narrowly into the
      girl's face on her descent Colonel Gerald had only laughed; he did not
      feel any distressing weight of responsibility on the subject of the
      guardianship of his daughter, for he had not given a single thought to the
      accident of his daughter's straying up the ravine with Algernon Glaston,
      nor was he impressed by his daughter's behaviour on the day following.
      They had driven out together to pay some visits, and she had been even
      more affectionate to him than usual, and he justified Mrs. Crawford's
      accusation of his ignorance and the ignorance of men generally, by
      feeling, from this fact, more assured that Daireen had passed unscathed
      through the ordeal of sunset and the drawing on of twilight on the mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day to that on which they had paid their visits, however,
      Daireen seemed somewhat abstracted in her manner, and when her father
      asked her if she would ride with him and Standish to The Flats she, for
      the first time, brought forward a plea&mdash;the plea of weariness&mdash;to
      be allowed to remain at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father looked at her, not narrowly nor with the least glance of
      suspicion, only tenderly, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, stay at home if you wish, Dolly. You must not overtax
      yourself, or we shall have to get a nurse for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat by her side on the chair on the stoep of the Dutch cottage and put
      his arm about her. In an instant she had clasped him round the neck and
      had hidden her face upon his shoulder in something like hysterical
      passion. He laughed and patted her on the back in mock protest at her
      treatment. It was some time before she unwound her arms and he got upon
      his feet, declaring that he would not submit to such rough handling. But
      all the same he saw that her eyes were full of tears; and as he rode with
      Standish over the sandy plain made bright with heath, he thought more than
      once that there was something strange in her action and still stranger in
      her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standish, however, felt equal to explaining everything that seemed
      unaccountable. He felt there could be no doubt that Daireen was wearying
      of these rides with him: he was nothing more than a brother&mdash;a dull,
      wearisome, commonplace brother to her, while such fellows as Glaston, who
      had made fame for themselves, having been granted the opportunity denied
      to others, were naturally attractive to her. Feeling this, Standish once
      more resolved to enter upon that enterprise of work which he felt to be
      ennobling. He would no longer linger here in silken-folded idleness, he
      would work&mdash;work&mdash;work&mdash;steadfastly, nobly, to win her who
      was worth all the labour of a man's life. Yes, he would no longer remain
      inactive as he had been, he would&mdash;well, he lit another cigar and
      trotted up to the side of Colonel Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Daireen, after the departure of her father and Standish, continued
      sitting upon the chair under the lovely creeping plants that twined
      themselves around the lattice of the projecting roof. It was very cool in
      the gracious shade while all the world outside was red with heat. The
      broad leaves of the plants in the garden were hanging languidly, and the
      great black bees plunged about the mighty roses that were bursting into
      bloom with the first breath of the southern summer. From the brink of the
      little river at the bottom of the avenue of Australian oaks the chatter of
      the Hottentot washerwomen came, and across the intervening space of short
      tawny grass a Malay fruitman passed, carrying his baskets slung on each
      end of a bamboo pole across his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked out at the scene&mdash;so strange to her even after the weeks
      she had been at this place; all was strange to her&mdash;as the thoughts
      that were in her mind. It seemed to her that she had been but one day at
      this place, and yet since she had heard the voice of Oswin Markham how
      great a space had passed! All the days she had been here were swallowed up
      in the interval that had elapsed since she had seen this man&mdash;since
      she had seen him? Why, there he was before her very eyes, standing by the
      side of his horse with the bridle over his arm. There he was watching her
      while she had been thinking her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood amongst the blossoms of the trellis, white and lovely as a lily
      in a land of red sun. He felt her beauty to be unutterably gracious to
      look upon. He threw his bridle over a branch and walked up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to say good-bye,&rdquo; he said as he took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the same words that she had heard from Harwood a few days
      before and that had caused her to smile. But now the hand Markham was not
      holding was pressed against her heart. Now she knew all. There was no
      mystery between them. She knew why her heart became still after beating
      tumultuously for a few seconds; and he, though he had not designed the
      words with the same object that Harwood had, and though he spoke them
      without the same careful observance of their effect, in another instant
      had seen what was in the girl's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To say good-bye?&rdquo; she repeated mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a time, yes; for a long time it will seem to me&mdash;for a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw the faint smile that came to her face, and how her lips parted as a
      little sigh of relief passed through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a month?&rdquo; she said, and now she was speaking in her own voice, and
      sitting down. &ldquo;A month is not a long time to say good-bye for, Mr.
      Markham. But I am so sorry that papa is gone out for his ride on The
      Flats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fortunate in finding even you here, then,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunate! Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But where do you mean to spend this month?&rdquo;
       she continued, feeling that he was now nothing more than a visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very ridiculous&mdash;very foolish,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I promised, you
      know, to act in some entertainment Miss Vincent has been getting up, and
      only yesterday her father received orders to proceed to Natal; but as all
      the fellows who had promised her to act are in the company of the
      Bayonetteers that has also been ordered off, no difference will be made in
      her arrangements, only that the performance will take place at
      Pietermaritzburg instead of at Cape Town. But she is so unreasonable as to
      refuse to release me from my promise, and I am bound to go with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a compliment to value your services so highly, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be glad to sacrifice all the gratification I find from thinking
      so for the sake of being released. She is both absurd and unreasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it would certainly strike any one hearing only of this,&rdquo; said Daireen.
      &ldquo;But it will only be for a month, and you will see the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather remain seeing this place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Seeing that hill
      above us.&rdquo; She flushed as though he had told her in those words that he
      was aware of how often she had been looking up to that slope since they
      had been there together&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, through which the voices and laughter of the women
      at the river-bank were heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen,&rdquo; said the man, who stood up bareheaded before her. &ldquo;Daireen,
      that hour we sat up there upon that slope has changed all my thoughts of
      life. I tell you the life which you restored to me a month ago I had
      ceased to regard as a gift. I had come to hope that it would end speedily.
      You cannot know how wretched I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; she said, looking up to him. &ldquo;And now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Now&mdash;what can I tell you? If I were to be cut
      off from life and happiness now, I should stand before God and say that I
      have had all the happiness that can be joined to one life on earth. I have
      had that one hour with you, and no God or man can take it from me: I have
      lived that hour, and none can make me unlive it. I told you I would say no
      word of love to you then, but I have come to say the word now. Child, I
      dared not love you as I was&mdash;I had no thought worthy to be devoted to
      loving you. God knows how I struggled with all my soul to keep myself from
      doing you the injustice of thinking of you; but that hour at your feet has
      given me something of your divine nature, and with that which I have
      caught from you, I can love you. Daireen, will you take the love I offer
      you? It it yours&mdash;all yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not speaking passionately, but when she looked up and saw his face
      haggard with earnestness she was almost frightened&mdash;she would have
      been frightened if she had not loved him as she now knew she did. &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;speak to me&mdash;one word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What one word can I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all that is in your heart, Daireen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up to him again. &ldquo;All?&rdquo; she said with a little smile. &ldquo;All? No,
      I could never tell you all. You know a little of it. That is the bond
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and actually took a few steps from her. On his face was an
      expression that could not easily have been read. But in an instant he
      seemed to recover himself. He took her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Past has buried its dead. I shall make myself
      worthy to think of you&mdash;I swear it to you. You shall have a true man
      to love.&rdquo; He was almost fierce in his earnestness, and her hand that he
      held was crushed for an instant. Then he looked into her face with
      tenderness. &ldquo;How have you come to answer my love with yours?&rdquo; he said
      almost wonderingly. &ldquo;What was there in me to make you think of my
      existence for a single instant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him. &ldquo;You were&mdash;<i>you</i>,&rdquo; she said, offering him the
      only explanation in her power. It had seemed to her easy enough to explain
      as she looked at him. Who else was worth loving with this love in all the
      world, she thought. He alone was worthy of all her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, my darling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am unworthy to have a single thought
      of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are indeed if you continue talking so,&rdquo; she said with a laugh, for
      she felt unutterably happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will not talk so. I will make myself worthy to think of you by&mdash;by&mdash;thinking
      of you. For a month, Daireen,&mdash;for a month we can only think of each
      other. It is better that I should not see you until the last tatter of my
      old self is shred away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be better that you should go away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why should you
      go away just as we are so happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go, Daireen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must go&mdash;and now. I would to God I
      could stay! but believe me, I cannot, darling; I feel that I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you made that stupid promise?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That promise is nothing. What is such a promise to me now? If I had never
      made it I should still go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking down at her as he spoke. &ldquo;Do not ask me to say anything
      more. There is nothing more to be said. Will you forget me in a month, do
      you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that there was a touch of anxiety in the tone of his
      question? she thought for an instant. Then she looked into his face and
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Daireen!&rdquo; he said tenderly, and there was sadness rather
      than passion in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God keep you, Daireen! May nothing but happiness ever come to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand to her, and she laid her own trustfully in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say good-bye,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Think that it is only for a month&mdash;less
      than a month, it must be. You can surely be back in less than a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I can, and I will be back within a month, and then&mdash;&mdash;
      God keep you, Daireen, for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was holding her hand in his own with all gentleness. His face was bent
      down close to hers, but he did not kiss her face, only her hand. He
      crushed it to his lips, and then dropped it. She was blinded with her
      tears, so that she did not see him hasten away through the avenue of oaks.
      She did not even hear his horse's tread, nor could she know that he had
      not once turned round to give her a farewell look.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some minutes before she seemed to realise that she was alone. She
      sprang to her feet and stood looking out over those deathly silent broad
      leaves, and those immense aloes, that seemed to be the plants in a picture
      of a strange region. She heard the laughter of the Hottentot women at the
      river, and the unmusical shriek of a bird in the distance. She clasped her
      hands over her head, looking wistfully through the foliage of the oaks,
      but she did not utter a word. He was gone, she knew now, for she felt a
      loneliness that overwhelmed every other feeling. She seemed to be in the
      middle of a bare and joyless land. The splendid shrubs that branched
      before her eyes seemed dead, and the silence of the warm scented air was a
      terror to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone, she knew, and there was nothing left for her but this
      loneliness. She went into her room in the cottage and seated herself upon
      her little sofa, hiding her face in her hands, and she felt it good to
      pray for him&mdash;for this man whom she had come to love, she knew not
      how. But she knew she loved him so that he was a part of her own life, and
      she felt that it would always be so. She could scarcely think what her
      life had been before she had seen him. How could she ever have fancied
      that she loved her father before this man had taught her what it was to
      love? Now she felt how dear beyond all thought her father was to her. It
      was not merely love for himself that she had learnt from Oswin Markham, it
      was the power of loving truly and perfectly that he had taught her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she dreamed until she heard the pleasant voice of her friend Mrs.
      Crawford in the hall. Then she rose and wondered if every one would not
      notice the change that had passed over her. Was it not written upon her
      face? Would not every touch of her hand&mdash;every word of her voice,
      betray it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she lifted up her head and felt equal to facing even Mrs. Crawford,
      and to acknowledging all that she believed the acute observation of that
      lady would read from her face as plainly as from the page of a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed that Mrs. Crawford's eyes were heavy this afternoon, for
      though she looked into Daireen's face and kissed her cheek affectionately,
      she made no accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lucky in finding you all alone, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is so
      different ashore from aboard ship. I have not really had one good chat
      with you since we landed. George is always in the way, or the major, you
      know&mdash;ah, you think I should rather say the colonel and Jack, but
      indeed I think of your father only as Lieutenant George. And you enjoyed
      our little lunch on the hill, I hope? I thought you looked pale when you
      came down. Was it not a most charming sunset?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was indeed,&rdquo; said Daireen, straining her eyes to catch a glimpse
      through the window of the slope where the red light had rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would enjoy it, my dear. Mr. Glaston is such good company&mdash;ah,
      that is, of course, to a sympathetic mind. And I don't think I am going
      too far, Daireen, when I say that I am sure he was in company with a
      sympathetic mind the evening before last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford was smiling as one smiles passing a graceful compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he was,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;Miss Vincent and he always seemed pleased
      with each other's society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Vincent?&mdash;Lottie Vincent?&rdquo; cried the lady in a puzzled but
      apprehensive way. &ldquo;What do you mean, Daireen? Lottie Vincent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know Mr. Glaston and Miss Vincent went away from us, among the
      silver leaves, and only returned as we were coming down the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford was speechless for some moments. Then she looked at the
      girl, saying, &ldquo;<i>We</i>,&mdash;who were <i>we?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Markham and myself,&rdquo; replied Daireen without faltering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed,&rdquo; said the other pleasantly. Then there was a pause before she
      added, &ldquo;That ends my association with Lottie Vincent. The artful,
      designing little creature! Daireen, you have no idea what good nature it
      required on my part to take any notice of that girl, knowing so much as I
      do of her; and this is how she treats me! Never mind; I have done with
      her.&rdquo; Seeing the girl's puzzled glance, Mrs. Crawford began to recollect
      that it could not be expected that Daireen should understand the nature of
      Lottie's offence; so she added, &ldquo;I mean, you know, dear, that that girl is
      full of spiteful, designing tricks upon every occasion. And yet she had
      the effrontery to come to me yesterday to beg of me to take charge of her
      while her father would be at Natal. But I was not quite so weak. Never
      mind; she leaves tomorrow, thank goodness, and that is the last I mean to
      see of her. But about Mr. Markham: I hope you do not think I had anything
      to say in the matter of letting you be with him, Daireen. I did not mean
      it, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; said Daireen quietly&mdash;so quietly that Mrs.
      Crawford began to wonder could it be possible that the girl wished to show
      that she had been aware of the plans which had been designed on her
      behalf. Before she had made up her mind, however, the horses of Colonel
      Gerald and Standish were heard outside, and in a moment afterwards the
      colonel entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Daireen almost at once, &ldquo;Mr. Markham rode out to see you this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed? I am sorry I missed him,&rdquo; he said quietly. But Mrs. Crawford
      stared at the girl, wondering what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to say good-bye, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford's heart began to beat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, is he returning to England?&rdquo; asked the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; he is only about to follow Mr. Harwood's example and go up to
      Natal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he need not have said good-bye, anymore than Harwood,&rdquo; remarked the
      colonel; and his daughter felt it hard to restrain herself from throwing
      her arms about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, &ldquo;Miss Lottie has triumphed! This Mr. Markham
      will go up in the steamer with her, and will probably act with her in this
      theatrical nonsense she is always getting up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is to act with her certainly,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;Ah! Lottie has made a
      success at last,&rdquo; cried the elder lady. &ldquo;Mr. Markham will suit her
      admirably. They will be engaged before they reach Algoa Bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Kate, why will you always jump at conclusions?&rdquo; said the colonel.
      &ldquo;Markham is a fellow of far too much sense to be in the least degree led
      by such a girl as Lottie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daireen had hold of her father's arm, and when he had spoken she turned
      round and kissed him. But it was not at all unusual for her to kiss him in
      this fashion on his return from a ride.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E had got a good
      deal to think about, this Mr. Oswin Markham, as he stood on the bridge of
      the steamer that was taking him round the coast to Natal, and looked back
      at that mountain whose strange shape had never seemed stranger than it did
      from the distance of the Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Table Mountain was of a blue dimness, and the white walls of the houses at
      its base were quite hidden; Robbin Island lighthouse had almost dwindled
      out of sight; and in the water, through the bright red gold shed from a
      mist in the west that the falling sun saturated with light, were seen the
      black heads of innumerable seals swimming out from the coastway of rocks.
      Yes, Mr. Oswin Markham had certainly a good deal to think about as he
      looked back to the flat-ridged mountain, and, mentally, upon all that had
      taken place since he had first seen its ridges a few weeks before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thought it well to talk of love to that girl who had given him the
      gift of the life he was at present breathing&mdash;to talk to her of love
      and to ask her to love him. Well, he had succeeded; she had put her hand
      trustfully in his and had trusted him with all her heart, he knew; and yet
      the thought of it did not make him happy. His heart was not the heart of
      one who has triumphed. It was only full of pity for the girl who had
      listened to him and replied to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for himself he felt what was more akin to shame than any other feeling&mdash;shame,
      that, knowing all he did of himself, he had still spoken those words to
      the girl to whom he owed the life that was now his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! was it not forced upon me when I struggled against it with all my
      soul?&rdquo; he said, in an endeavour to strangle his bitter feeling. &ldquo;Did not I
      make up my mind to leave the ship when I saw what was coming upon me, and
      was I to be blamed if I could not do so? Did not I rush away from her
      without a word of farewell? Did not we meet by chance that night in the
      moonlight? Were those words that I spoke to her thought over? Were not
      they forced from me against my own will, and in spite of my resolution?&rdquo;
       There could be no doubt that if any one acquainted with all the matters to
      which he referred had been ready to answer him, a satisfactory reply would
      have been received by him to each of his questions. But though, of course,
      he was aware of this, yet he seemed to find it necessary to alter the
      ground of the argument he was advancing for his own satisfaction. &ldquo;I have
      a right to forget the wretched past,&rdquo; he said, standing upright and
      looking steadfastly across the glowing waters. &ldquo;Have not I died for the
      past? Is not this life a new one? It is God's justice that I am carrying
      out by forgetting all. The past is past, and the future in all truth and
      devotion is hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were, indeed, some moments of his life&mdash;and the present was one
      of them&mdash;when he felt satisfied in his conscience by assuring
      himself, as he did now, that as God had taken away all remembrance of the
      past from many men who had suffered the agonies of death, he was therefore
      entitled to let his past life and its recollections drift away on that
      broken mast from which he had been cut in the middle of the ocean; but the
      justice of the matter had not occurred to him when he got that bank order
      turned into money at the Cape, nor at the time when he had written to the
      agents of his father's property in England, informing them of his escape.
      He now stood up and spoke those words of his, and felt their force, until
      the sun, whose outline had all the afternoon been undefined in the mist,
      sank beneath the horizon, and the gorgeous colours drifted round from his
      sinking place and dwindled into the dark green of the waters. He watched
      the sunset, and though Lottie Vincent came to his side in her most playful
      mood, her fresh and artless young nature found no response to its impulses
      in him. She turned away chilled, but no more discouraged than a little
      child, who, desirous of being instructed on the secret of the creative art
      embodied in the transformation of a handkerchief into a rabbit, finds its
      mature friend reflecting upon a perplexing point in the theory of
      Unconscious Cerebration. Lottie knew that her friend Mr. Oswin Markham
      sometimes had to think about matters of such a nature as caused her little
      pleasantries to seem incongruous. She thought that now she had better turn
      to a certain Lieutenant Clifford, who, she knew, had no intricate mental
      problems to work out; and she did turn to him, with great advantage to
      herself, and, no doubt, to the officer as well. However forgetful Oswin
      Markham may have been of his past life, he could still recollect a few
      generalities that had struck him in former years regarding young persons
      of a nature similar to this pretty little Miss Vincent's. She had insisted
      on his fulfilling his promise to act with her, and he would fulfil it with
      a good grace; but at this point his contract terminated; he would not be
      tempted into making another promise to her which he might find much more
      embarrassing to carry out with consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a great grief to Lottie to be compelled, through the
      ridiculous treatment of her father by the authorities in ordering him to
      Natal, to transfer her dramatic entertainment from Cape Town to
      Pietermaritzburg. However, as she had sold a considerable number of
      tickets to her friends, she felt that &ldquo;the most deserving charity,&rdquo; the
      augmentation of whose funds was the avowed object of the entertainment,
      would be benefited in no inconsiderable degree by the change of venue. If
      the people of Pietermaritzburg would steadfastly decline to supply her
      with so good an audience as the Cape Town people, there still would be a
      margin of profit, since her friends who had bought tickets on the
      understanding that the performance would take place where it was at first
      intended, did not receive their money back. How could they expect such a
      concession, Lottie asked, with innocent indignation; and begged to be
      informed if it was her fault that her father was ordered to Natal. Besides
      this one unanswerable query, she reminded those who ventured to make a
      timid suggestion regarding the returns, that it was in aid of a most
      deserving charity the tickets had been sold, so that it would be an act of
      injustice to give back a single shilling that had been paid for the
      tickets. Pursuing this very excellent system, Miss Lottie had to the
      credit of the coming performance a considerable sum which would provide
      against the contingencies of a lack of dramatic enthusiasm amongst the
      inhabitants of Pietermaritzburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the garden-party at Government House that Markham had by
      accident mentioned to Lottie that he had frequently taken part in dramatic
      performances for such-like objects as Lottie's was designed to succour,
      and though he at first refused to be a member, of her company, yet at Mrs.
      Crawford's advocacy of the claims of the deserving object, he had agreed
      to place his services and experience at the disposal of the originator of
      the benevolent scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cape Town he had not certainly thrown himself very heartily into the
      business of creating a part in the drama which had been selected. He was
      well aware that if a good performance of the nature designed by Lottie is
      successful, a bad performance is infinitely more so; and that any attempt
      on the side of an amateur to strike out a new character from an old part
      is looked upon with suspicion, and is generally attended with disaster; so
      he had not given himself any trouble in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he had said in reply to a pretty little
      remonstrance from the young lady, &ldquo;the department of study requiring most
      attention in a dramatic entertainment of this sort is the financial. Sell
      all the tickets you can, and you will be a greater benefactress to the
      charity than if you acted like a Kemble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lottie had taken his advice; but still she made up her mind that Mr.
      Markham's name should be closely associated with the entertainment, and
      consequently, with her own name. Had she not been at pains to put into
      circulation certain stories of the romance surrounding him, and thus
      disposed of an unusual number of stalls? For even if one is not possessed
      of any dramatic inclinations, one is always ready to pay a price for
      looking at a man who has been saved from a shipwreck, or who has been the
      co-respondent in some notorious law case.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the fellows of the Bayonetteers, who had been indulging in a number
      of surmises regarding Lottie's intentions with respect to Markham, heard
      that the young lady's father had been ordered to proceed to Natal without
      delay, the information seemed to give them a good deal of merriment. The
      man who offered four to one that Lottie should not be able to get any lady
      friend to take charge of her in Cape Town until her father's return, could
      get no one to accept his odds; but his proposal of three to one that she
      would get Markham to accompany her to Natal was eagerly taken up; so that
      there were several remarks made at the mess reflecting upon the acuteness
      of Mr. Markham's perception when it was learned that he was going with the
      young lady and her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; remarked the man who had laid the odds, &ldquo;I knew something of
      Lottie in India, and I knew what she was equal to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lottie is a devilish smart child, by Jove,&rdquo; said one of the losers
      meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has probably cut her eye-teeth some years ago,&rdquo; hazarded another
      subaltern.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a considerable pause before a third of this full bench delivered
      final judgment as the result of the consideration of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor beggar!&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;poor beggar! he's a finished coon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that Mr. Oswin Markham was, indeed, a man whose career had been
      defined for him by another in the plainest possible manner, no member of
      the mess seemed to doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first couple of days of the voyage round the coast, when Miss
      Lottie would go to the side of Mr. Markham for the purpose of consulting
      him on some important point of detail in the intended performance, the
      shrewd young fellows of the regiment of Bayonetteers pulled their phantom
      shreds of moustaches, and brought the muscles of their faces about the
      eyes into play to a remarkable extent, with a view of assuring one another
      of the possession of an unusual amount of sagacity by the company to which
      they belonged. But when, after the third day of rehearsals. Lottie's
      manner of gentle persuasiveness towards them altered to nasty bitter
      upbraidings of the young man who had committed the trifling error of
      overlooking an entire scene here and there in working out the character he
      was to bring before the audience, and to a most hurtful glance of scorn at
      the other aspirant who had marked off in the margin of his copy of the
      play all the dialogue he was to speak, but who, unfortunately, had picked
      up a second copy belonging to a young lady in which another part had been
      similarly marked, so that he had, naturally enough, perfected himself in
      the dialogue of the lady's rôle without knowing a letter of his own&mdash;when,
      for such trifling slips as these, Lottie was found to be so harsh, the
      deep young fellows made their facial muscles suggest a doubt as to whether
      it might not be possible that Markham was of a sterner and less malleable
      nature then they had at first believed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that since Lottie had met with Oswin Markham she had been in
      considerable perplexity of mind. She had found out that he was in by no
      means indigent circumstances; but even with her guileless, careless
      perceptions, she was not long in becoming aware that he was not likely to
      be moulded according to her desires; so, while still behaving in a
      fascinating manner towards him, she had had many agreeable half-hours with
      Mr. Glaston, who was infinitely more plastic, she could see; but so soon
      as the order had come for her father to go up to Natal she had returned in
      thought to Oswin Markham, and had smiled to see the grins upon the
      expressive faces of the officers of the Bayonetteers when she found
      herself by the side of Oswin Markham. She rather liked these grins, for
      she had an idea&mdash;in her own simple way, of course&mdash;that there is
      a general tendency on the part of young people to associate when their
      names have been previously associated. She knew that the fact of her
      having persuaded this Mr. Markham to accompany her to Natal would cause
      his name to be joined with hers pretty frequently, and in her innocence
      she had no objection to make to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Markham himself, he knew perfectly well what remarks people would
      make on the subject of his departure in the steamer with Lottie Vincent;
      he knew before he had been a day on the voyage that the Bayonetteers
      regarded him as somewhat deficient in firmness; but he felt that there was
      no occasion for him to be utterly broken down in spirit on account of this
      opinion being held by the Bayonetteers. He was not so blind but that he
      caught a glimpse now and again of a facial distortion on the part of a
      member of the company. He felt that it was probable these far-seeing
      fellows would be disappointed at the result of their surmises.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed the fellows of the regiment were beginning, before the voyage
      was quite over, to feel that this Mr. Oswin Markham was not altogether of
      the yielding nature which they had ascribed to him on the grounds of his
      having promised Lottie Vincent to accompany her and her father to Natal at
      this time. About Lottie herself there was but one opinion expressed, and
      that was of such a character as any one disposed to ingratiate himself
      with the girl by means of flattery would hardly have hastened to
      communicate to her; for the poor little thing had been so much worried of
      late over the rehearsals which she was daily conducting aboard the
      steamer, that, failing to meet with any expression of sympathy from Oswin
      Markham, she had spoken very freely to some of the company in comment upon
      their dramatic capacity, and not even an amateur actor likes to receive
      unreserved comment of an unfavourable character upon his powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a confounded little humbug,&rdquo; said one of the subalterns to Oswin
      in confidence on the last day of the voyage. &ldquo;Hang me if I would have had
      anything to say to this deuced mummery if I had known what sort of a girl
      she was. By George, you should hear the stories Kirkham has on his
      fingers' ends about her in India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswin laughed quietly. &ldquo;It would be rash, if not cruel, to believe all the
      stories that are told about girls in India,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As for Miss
      Vincent, I believe her to be a charming girl&mdash;as an actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, who had not left his grinder on English
      literature long enough to forget all that he had learned of the literature
      of the past century&mdash;&ldquo;yes; she is an actress among girls, and a girl
      among actresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Oswin; &ldquo;very good. What is it that somebody or other remarked
      about Lord Chesterfield as a wit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the other, ceasing the laugh he had commenced. &ldquo;What I
      say about Lottie is true.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>F course,&rdquo; said
      Lottie, as she stood by the side of Oswin Markham when the small steamer
      which had been specially engaged to take the field-officers of the
      Bayonetteers over the dreaded bar of Durban harbour was approaching the
      quay&mdash;&ldquo;of course we shall all go together up to Pietermaritzburg. I
      have been there before, you know. We shall have a coach all to ourselves
      from Durban.&rdquo; She looked up to his face with only the least questioning
      expression upon her own. But Mr. Markham thought that he had made quite
      enough promises previously: it would be unwise to commit himself even in
      so small a detail as the manner of the journey from the port of Durban to
      the garrison town of Pietermaritzburg, which he knew was at a distance of
      upwards of fifty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the least idea what I shall do when we land,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is
      probable that I shall remain at the port for some days. I may as well see
      all that there is on view in this part of the colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was very distressing to the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to desert me?&rdquo; she asked somewhat reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desert you?&rdquo; he said in a puzzled way. &ldquo;Ah, those are the words in a
      scene in your part, are they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lottie became irritated almost beyond the endurance of a naturally patient
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to leave me to stand alone against all my difficulties, Mr.
      Markham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry to do that, Miss Vincent. If you have difficulties,
      tell me what they are; and if they are of such a nature that they can be
      curtailed by me, you may depend upon my exerting myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well what idiots these Bayonetteers are,&rdquo; cried Lottie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that most of them have promised to act in your theatricals,&rdquo;
       replied Markham quietly; and Lottie tried to read his soul in another of
      her glances to discover the exact shade of the meaning of his words, but
      she gave up the quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can please yourself, Mr. Markham,&rdquo; she said, with a
      coldness that was meant to appal him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I trust that I may never be led to do so at the expense of another,&rdquo;
       he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will come in our coach?&rdquo; she cried, brightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not descend to particulars when we are talking in this vague way
      on broad matters of sentiment, Miss Vincent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must know what you intend to do at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once? I intend to go ashore, and try if it is possible to get a dinner
      worth eating. After that&mdash;well, this is Tuesday, and on Thursday week
      your entertainment will take place; before that day you say you want three
      rehearsals, then I will agree to be by your side at Pietermaritzburg on
      Saturday next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This business-like arrangement was not what Lottie on leaving Cape Town
      had meant to be the result of the voyage to Natal. There was a slight
      pause before she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by treating me in this way? I always thought you were my
      friend. What will papa say if you leave me to go up there alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a very daring bit of dialogue on the part of Miss Lottie, but
      they were nearing the quay where she knew Oswin would be free; aboard the
      mail steamer of course he was&mdash;well, scarcely free. But Mr. Markham
      was one of those men who are least discomfited by a daring stroke. He
      looked steadfastly at the girl so soon as she uttered her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The problem is too interesting to be allowed to pass, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;We shall do our best to have it answered. By Jove, doesn't that man
      on the quay look like Harwood? It is Harwood indeed, and I thought him
      among the Zulus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first man caught sight of on the quay was indeed the special
      correspondent of the <i>Dominant Trumpeter</i>. Lottie's manner changed
      instantly on seeing him, and she gave one of her girlish laughs on
      noticing the puzzled expression upon his face as he replied to her
      salutations while yet afar. She was very careful to keep by the side of
      Oswin until the steamer was at the quay; and when at last Harwood
      recognised the features of the two persons who had been saluting him, she
      saw him look with a little smile first to herself, then to Oswin, and she
      thought it prudent to give a small guilty glance downwards and to repeat
      her girlish laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswin saw Harwood's glance and heard Lottie's laugh. He also heard the
      young lady making an explanation of certain matters, to which Harwood
      answered with a second little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind? Oh, exceedingly kind of him to come so long a distance for the sake
      of assisting you. Nothing could be kinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel it to be so indeed,&rdquo; said Miss Vincent. &ldquo;I feel that I can never
      repay Mr. Markham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again that smile came to Mr. Harwood as he said: &ldquo;Do not take such a
      gloomy view of the matter, my dear Miss Vincent; perhaps on reflection
      some means may be suggested to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you mean?&rdquo; cried the puzzled little thing, tripping away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Harwood, in spite of your advice to me, you see I am here not more
      than a week behind yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are looking better than I could have believed possible for any
      one in the condition you were in when I left,&rdquo; said Harwood. &ldquo;Upon my
      word, I did not expect much from you as I watched you go up the stairs at
      the hotel after that wild ride of yours to and from no place in
      particular. But, of course, there are circumstances under which fellows
      look knocked up, and there are others that combine to make them seem quite
      the contrary; now it seems to me you are subject to the influence of the
      latter just at present.&rdquo; He glanced as if by accident over to where Lottie
      was making a pleasant little fuss about some articles of her luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Markham&mdash;&ldquo;quite right. I have reason to be
      particularly elated just now, having got free from that steamer and my
      fellow-passengers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the fellows of the Bayonetteers struck me as being particularly good
      company,&rdquo; said Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so they were. Now I must look after this precious portmanteau of
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And assist that helpless little creature to look after hers,&rdquo; muttered
      Harwood when the other had left him. &ldquo;Poor little Lottie! is it possible
      that you have landed a prize at last? Well, no one will say that you don't
      deserve something for your years of angling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood felt very charitably inclined just at this instant, for his
      reflections on the behaviour of Markham during the last few days they had
      been at the same hotel at Cape Town had not by any means been quieted
      since they had parted. He was sorry to be compelled to leave Cape Town
      without making any discovery as to the mental condition of Markham. Now,
      however, he knew that Markham had been strong enough to come on to Natal,
      so that the searching out of the problem of his former weakness would be
      as uninteresting as it would be unprofitable. If there should chance to be
      any truth in that vague thought which had been suggested to him as to the
      possibility of Markham having become attached to Daireen Gerald, what did
      it matter now? Here was Markham, having overcome his weakness, whatever it
      may have been, by the side of Lottie Vincent; not indeed appearing to be
      in great anxiety regarding the welfare of the young lady's luggage which
      was being evil-treated, but still by her side, and this made any further
      thought on his behalf unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Markham had given his portmanteau into the charge of one of the Natal
      Zulus, and then he turned to Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mind my asking you what you are doing at Durban instead of
      being at the other side of the Tugela?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Zulus of this province require to be treated of most carefully in the
      first instance, before the great question of Zulus in their own territory
      can be fully understood by the British public,&rdquo; replied the correspondent.
      &ldquo;I am at present making the Zulu of Durban my special study. I suppose you
      will be off at once to Pietermaritzburg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Markham. &ldquo;I intend remaining at Durban to study the&mdash;the
      Zulu characteristics for a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Lottie&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;Miss Vincent is going on at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pause, during which Markham stared blankly at his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth has that got to say to my remaining here?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harwood looked at him and felt that Miss Lottie was right, even on purely
      artistic grounds, in choosing Oswin Markham as one of her actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing of course,&rdquo; he replied to Markham's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Lottie had heard more than a word of this conversation. She
      tripped up to Mr. Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you make some inquiry about your old friends, you most
      ungrateful of men?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, I have such a lot to tell you. Dear
      old Mrs. Crawford was in great grief about your going away, you know&mdash;oh,
      such great grief that she was forced to give a picnic the second day after
      you left, for fear we should all have broken down utterly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very kind of Mrs. Crawford,&rdquo; said Harwood; &ldquo;and it only remains
      for me to hope fervently that the required effect was produced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I was concerned, it was,&rdquo; said Lottie. &ldquo;But it would never do
      for me to speak for other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, other people&mdash;the charming Miss Gerald, for instance; I cannot
      speak for her, but Mr. Markham certainly can, for he lay at her feet
      during the entire of the afternoon when every one else had wandered away
      up the ravine. Yes, Mr. Markham will tell you to a shade what her feelings
      were upon that occasion. Now, bye-bye. You will come to our little
      entertainment next week, will you not? And you will turn up on Saturday
      for rehearsal?&rdquo; she added, smiling at Oswin, who was looking more stern
      than amused. &ldquo;Don't forget&mdash;Saturday. You should be very grateful for
      my giving you liberty for so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men went ashore together without a word; nor did they fall at once
      into a fluent chat when they set out for the town, which was more than two
      miles distant; for Mr. Harwood was thinking out another of the problems
      which seemed to suggest themselves to him daily from the fact of his
      having an acute ear for discerning the shades of tone in which his friends
      uttered certain phrases. He was just now engaged linking fancy unto fancy,
      thinking if it was a little impulse of girlish jealousy, meant only to
      give a mosquito-sting to Oswin Markham, that had caused Miss Lottie
      Vincent to make that reference to Miss Gerald, or if it was a piece of
      real bitterness designed to wound deeply. It was an interesting problem,
      and Mr. Harwood worked at its solution very patiently, weighing all his
      recollections of past words and phrases that might tend to a satisfactory
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the greatest amount of satisfaction was not afforded to Mr. Harwood by
      the pursuit of the intricacies of the question he had set himself to work
      out, but by the reflection that at any rate Markham's being at Natal and
      not within easy riding distance of a picturesque Dutch cottage at Mowbray,
      was a certain good. What did it signify now if Markham had previously been
      too irresolute to tear himself away from the association of that cottage?
      Had he not afterwards proved himself sufficiently strong? And if this
      strength had come to him through any conversation he might have had with
      Miss Gerald on the hillside to which Lottie had alluded, or elsewhere,
      what business was it to anybody? Here was Markham&mdash;there was Durban,
      and this was satisfactory. Only&mdash;what did Lottie mean exactly by that
      little bit of spitefulness or bitterness?

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>PON the evening of
      the Thursday week after the arrival of that steamer with two companies of
      the Bayonetteers at Durban, the town of Pietermaritzburg was convulsed
      with the prospect of the entertainment that was to take place in its
      midst, for Miss Lottie Vincent had not passed the preceding week in a
      condition of dramatic abstraction. She was by no means so wrapped up in
      the part she had undertaken to represent as to be unable to give the
      necessary attention to the securing of an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem to a casual <i>entrepreneur</i> visiting Pietermaritzburg
      that a large audience might be assured for an entertainment possessing
      even the minimum of attractiveness, for the town appears to be of an
      immense size&mdash;that is, for a South African town. The colonial Romulus
      and Remus have shown at all times very lordly notions on the subject of
      boundaries, and, being subject to none of those restrictions as to the
      cost of every square foot of territory which have such a cramping
      influence upon the founders of municipalities at home, they exercise their
      grand ideas in the most extensive way. The streets of an early colonial
      town are broad roads, and the spaces between the houses are so great as
      almost to justify the criticism of those narrow-minded visitors who call
      the town straggling. At one time Pietermaritzburg may have been
      straggling, but it certainly did not strike Oswin Markham as being so when
      he saw it now for the first time on his arrival. He felt that it had got
      less of a Dutch look about it than Cape Town, and though that towering and
      overshadowing impression which Table Mountain gives to Cape Town was
      absent, yet the circle of hills about Pietermaritzburg seemed to him&mdash;and
      his fancy was not particularly original&mdash;to give the town almost that
      nestling appearance which by tradition is the natural characteristic of an
      English village.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if an <i>entrepreneur</i> should calculate the probable numerical
      value of an audience in Pietermaritzburg from a casual walk through the
      streets, he would find that his assumption had been founded upon an
      erroneous basis. The streets are long and in fact noble, but the
      inhabitants available for fulfilling the duties of an audience at a
      dramatic entertainment are out of all proportion few. Two difficulties are
      to be contended with in making up audiences in South Africa: the first is
      getting the people in, and the second is keeping people out. As a rule the
      races of different colour do not amalgamate with sufficient ease to allow
      of a mixed audience being pervaded with a common sympathy. A white man
      seated between a Hottentot and a Kafir will scarcely be brought to admit
      that he has had a pleasant evening, even though the performance on the
      stage is of a choice character. A single Zulu will make his presence
      easily perceptible in a room full of white people, even though he should
      remain silent and in a secluded corner; while a Hottentot, a Kafir, and a
      Zulu constitute a <i>bouquet d'Afrique</i>, the savour of which is apt to
      divert the attention of any one in their neighbourhood from the realistic
      effect of a garden scene upon the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lottie, being well aware that the audience-forming material in the
      town was small in proportion to the extent of the streets, set herself
      with her usual animation about the task of disposing of the remaining
      tickets. She fancied that she understood something of the system to be
      pursued with success amongst the burghers. She felt it to be her duty to
      pay a round of visits to the houses where she had been intimate in the
      days of her previous residence at the garrison; and she contrived to
      impress upon her friends that the ties of old acquaintance should be
      consolidated by the purchase of a number of her tickets. She visited
      several families who, she knew, had been endeavouring for a long time to
      work themselves into the military section of the town's society, and after
      hinting to them that the officers of the Bayonetteers would remain in the
      lowest spirits until they had made the acquaintance of the individual
      members of each of those families, she invariably disposed of a ticket to
      the individual member whose friendship was so longed for at the garrison.
      As for the tradesmen of the town, she managed without any difficulty, or
      even without forgetting her own standing, to make them aware of the
      possible benefits that would accrue to the business of the town under the
      patronage of the officers of the Bayonetteers; and so, instead of having
      to beg of the tradesmen to support the deserving charity on account of
      which she was taking such a large amount of trouble, she found herself
      thanked for the permission she generously accorded to these worthy men to
      purchase places for the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She certainly deserved well of the deserving charity, and the old
      field-officers, who rolled their eyes and pulled their moustaches,
      recollecting the former labours of Miss Lottie, had got as imperfect a
      knowledge of the proportions of her toil and reward as the less
      good-natured of their wives who alluded to the trouble she was taking as
      if it was not wholly disinterested. Lottie certainly took a vast amount of
      trouble, and if Oswin Markham only appeared at the beginning of each
      rehearsal and left at the conclusion, the success of the performance was
      not at all jeopardised by his action.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the entire week preceding the evening of the performance little else
      was talked about in all sections of Maritzburgian society but the
      prospects of its success. The ladies in the garrison were beginning to be
      wearied of the topic of theatricals, and the colonel of the Bayonetteers
      was heard to declare that he would not submit any longer to have the
      regimental parades only half-officered day by day, and that the plea of
      dramatic study would be insufficient in future to excuse an absentee. But
      this vigorous action was probably accelerated by the report that reached
      him of a certain lieutenant, who had only four lines to speak in the play,
      having escaped duty for the entire week on the grounds of the necessity
      for dramatic study.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the final nail was put in the fastenings of the scenery on the
      stage, which a number of the Royal Engineers, under the guidance of two
      officers and a clerk of the works, had erected; the footlights were after
      considerable difficulty coaxed into flame. The officers of the garrison
      and their wives made an exceedingly good front row in the stalls, and a
      number of the sergeants and privates filled up the back seats, ready to
      applaud, without reference to their merits at the performance, their
      favourite officers when they should appear on the stage; the intervening
      seats were supposed to be booked by the general audience, and their
      punctuality of attendance proved that Lottie's labours had not been in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood having tired of Durban, had been some days in the town, and he
      walked from the hotel with Markham; for Mr. Markham, though the part he
      was to play was one of most importance in the drama, did not think it
      necessary to hang about the stage for the three hours preceding the
      lifting of the curtain, as most of the Bayonetteers who were to act
      believed to be prudent. Harwood took a seat in the second row of stalls,
      for he had promised Lottie and one of the other young ladies who was in
      the cast, to give each of them a candid opinion upon their
      representations. For his own part he would have preferred giving his
      opinion before seeing the representations, for he knew what a strain would
      be put upon his candour after they were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the orchestra&mdash;which was a great feature of the performance&mdash;struck
      up an overture, the stage behind the curtain was crowded with figures in
      top-boots and with noble hats encircled with ostrich feathers&mdash;the
      element of brigandage entering largely into the construction of the drama
      of the evening. Each of the figures carried a small pamphlet which he
      studied every now and again, for in spite of the many missed parades, a
      good deal of uncertainty as to the text of their parts pervaded the minds
      of the histrionic Bayonetteers. Before the last notes of the overture had
      crashed, Lottie Vincent, radiant in pearl powder and pencilled eyebrows,
      wearing a plain muslin dress and white satin shoes, her fair hair with a
      lovely white rose shining amongst its folds, tripped out. Her character in
      the first act being that of a simple village maiden, she was dressed with
      becoming consistency, every detail down to those white satin shoes being,
      of course, in keeping with the ordinary attire of simple village maidens
      wherever civilisation has spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake leave aside your books,&rdquo; she said to the young men as
      she came forward. &ldquo;Do you mean to bring them out with you and read from
      them? Surely after ten rehearsals you might be perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang me, if I haven't a great mind not to appear at all in this rot,&rdquo;
       said one of the gentlemen in the top-boots to his companions. He had
      caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror a minute previously and he did not
      like the picture. &ldquo;If it was not for the sake of the people who have come
      I'd cut the whole affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has done nothing but bully,&rdquo; remarked a second of these desperadoes
      in top-boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All because that fellow Markham has shown himself to be no idiot,&rdquo; said a
      third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count Rodolph loves her, but I'll spare him not: he dies to-night,&rdquo;
       remarked another, but he was only refreshing his memory on the dialogue he
      was to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gentleman who was acting as prompter saw that the stage was
      cleared, he gave the signal for the orchestra to play the curtain up. At
      the correct moment, and with a perfection of stage management that would
      have been creditable to any dramatic establishment in the world, as one of
      the Natal newspapers a few days afterwards remarked with great justice,
      the curtain was raised, and an excellent village scene was disclosed to
      the enthusiastic audience. Two of the personages came on at once, and so
      soon as their identity was clearly established, the soldiers began to
      applaud, which was doubtless very gratifying to the two officers, from a
      regimental standpoint, though it somewhat interfered with the progress of
      the scene. The prompter, however, hastened to the aid of the young men who
      had lost themselves in that whirlwind of applause, and the dialogue began
      to run easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lottie had made for herself a little loophole in the back drop-scene
      through which she observed the audience. She saw that the place was
      crowded to the doors&mdash;English-speaking and Dutch-speaking burghers
      were in the central seats; she smiled as she noticed the aspirants to
      garrison intimacies crowding up as close as possible to the officers'
      wives in the front row, and she wondered if it would be necessary to
      acknowledge any of them for longer than a week. Then she saw Harwood with
      the faintest smile imaginable upon his face, as the young men on the stage
      repeated the words of their parts without being guilty either of the
      smallest mistake or the least dramatic spirit; and this time she wondered
      if, when she would be going through her part and she would look towards
      Harwood, she should find the same sort of smile upon his face. She rather
      thought not. Then, as the time for her call approached, she hastened round
      to her entrance, waiting until the poor stuff the two young men were
      speaking came to an end; then, not a second past her time, she entered,
      demure and ingenuous as all village maidens in satin slippers must surely
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not disappointed in her reception by the audience. The ladies in
      the front stalls who had spoken, it might be, unkindly of her in private,
      now showed their good nature in public, and the field officers forgot all
      the irregularities she had caused in the regiment and welcomed her
      heartily; while the tradesmen in the middle rows made their applause a
      matter of business. The village maiden with the satin shoes smiled in the
      timid, fluttered, dovelike way that is common amongst the class, and then
      went on with her dialogue. She felt altogether happy, for she knew that
      the young lady who was to appear in the second scene could not possibly
      meet with such an expression of good feeling as she had obtained from the
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the play might be said to have commenced in earnest. It was by no
      means a piece of French frivolity, this drama, but a genuine work of
      English art as it existed thirty years ago, and it was thus certain to
      commend itself to the Pietermaritzburghers who liked solidity even when it
      verged upon stolidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Throne or Spouse</i> was the title of the play, and if its incidents
      were somewhat improbable and its details utterly impossible, it was not
      the less agreeable to the audience. The two young men who had appeared in
      top-boots on the village green had informed each other, the audience
      happily overhearing, that they had been out hunting with a certain Prince,
      and that they had got separated from their companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They embraced the moment as opportune for the discussion of a few court
      affairs, such as the illness ot the monarch, and the Prince's prospects of
      becoming his successor, and then they thought it would be as well to try
      and find their way back to the court; so off they went. Then Miss Vincent
      came on the village green and reminded herself that her name was Marie and
      that she was a simple village maiden; she also recalled the fact that she
      lived alone with her mother in Yonder Cottage. It seemed to give her
      considerable satisfaction to reflect that, though poor, she was, and she
      took it upon her to say that her mother was also, strictly virtuous, and
      she wished to state in the most emphatic terms that though she was wooed
      by a certain Count Rodolph, yet, as she did not love him, she would never
      be his. Lottie was indeed very emphatic at this part, and her audience
      applauded her determination as Marie. Curiously enough, she had no sooner
      expressed herself in this fashion than one of the Bayonetteers entered,
      and at the sight of him Lottie called out, &ldquo;Ah, he is here! Count
      Rodolph!&rdquo; This the audience felt was a piece of subtle constructive art on
      the part of the author. Then the new actor replied, &ldquo;Yes, Count Rodolph is
      here, sweet Marie, where he would ever be, by the side of the fairest
      village maiden,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new actor was attired in one of the broad hats of the period&mdash;whatever
      it may have been&mdash;with a long ostrich feather. He had an immense
      black moustache, and his eyebrows were exceedingly heavy. He also wore
      top-boots, a long sword, and a black cloak, one fold of which he now and
      again threw over his left shoulder when it worked its way down his arm. It
      was not surprising that further on in the drama the Count was found to be
      a dissembler; his costume fostered any proclivities in this way that might
      otherwise have remained dormant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village maiden begged to know why the Count persecuted her with his
      attentions, and he replied that he did so on account of his love for her.
      She then assured him that she could never bring herself to look on him
      with favour; and this naturally drew from him the energetic declaration of
      his own passion for her. He concluded by asking her to be his: she cried
      with emphasis, &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; He repeated his application, and again she cried
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; and told him to begone. &ldquo;You shall be mine,&rdquo; he cried, catching
      her by the arm. &ldquo;Wretch, leave me,&rdquo; she said, in all her village-maiden
      dignity; he repeated his assertion, and clasped her round the waist with
      ardour. Then she shrieked for help, and a few simple villagers rushed
      hurriedly on the stage, but the Count drew his sword and threatened with
      destruction any one who might advance. The simple villagers thought it
      prudent to retire. &ldquo;Ha! now, proud Marie, you are in my power,&rdquo; said the
      Count. &ldquo;Is there no one to save me?&rdquo; shrieked Marie. &ldquo;Yes, here is some
      one who will save you or perish in the attempt,&rdquo; came a voice from the
      wings, and with an agitation pervading the sympathetic orchestra, a
      respectable young man in a green hunting-suit with a horn by his side and
      a drawn sword in his hand, rushed on, and was received with an outburst of
      applause from the audience who, in Pietermaritzburg, as in every place
      else, are ever on the side of virtue. This new actor was Oswin Markham,
      and it seemed that Lottie's stories regarding the romance associated with
      his appearance were successful, for not only was there much applause, but
      a quiet hum of remark was heard amongst the front stalls, and it was some
      moments before the business of the stage could be proceeded with.
    </p>
    <p>
      So soon as he was able to speak, the Count wished to know who was the
      intruder that dared to face one of the nobles of the land, and the
      intruder replied in general terms, dwelling particularly upon the fact
      that only those were noble who behaved nobly. He expressed an inclination
      to fight with the Count, but the latter declined to gratify him on account
      of the difference there was between their social standing, and he left the
      stage saying, &ldquo;Farewell, proud beauty, we shall meet again.&rdquo; Then he
      turned to the stranger, and, laying his hand on his sword-hilt after he
      had thrown his cloak over his shoulder, he cried, &ldquo;We too shall meet
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger then made some remarks to himself regarding the manner in
      which he was stirred by Marie's beauty. He asked her who she was, and she
      replied, truthfully enough, that she was a simple village maiden, and that
      she lived in Yonder Cottage. He then told her that he was a member of the
      Prince's retinue, and that he had lost his way at the hunt; and he begged
      the girl to conduct him to Yonder Cottage. The girl expressed her pleasure
      at being able to show him some little attention, but she remarked that the
      stranger would find Yonder Cottage very humble. She assured him, however,
      of the virtue of herself, and again went so far as to speak for her
      mother. The stranger then made a nice little speech about the constituents
      of true nobility, and went out with Marie as the curtain fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next scene was laid in Yonder Cottage; the virtuous mother being
      discovered knitting, and whiling away the time by talking to herself of
      the days when she was nurse to the late Queen. Then Marie and the stranger
      entered, and there was a pleasant family party in Yonder Cottage. The
      stranger was evidently struck with Marie, and the scene ended by his
      swearing to make her his wife. The next act showed the stranger in his
      true character as the Prince; his royal father has heard of his attachment
      to Marie, and not being an enthusiast on the subject of simple village
      maidens becoming allied to the royal house, he threatens to cut off the
      entail of the kingdom&mdash;which it appeared he had power to do&mdash;if
      the Prince does not relinquish Marie, and he dies leaving a clause in his
      will to this effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince rushes to Yonder Cottage&mdash;hears that Marie is carried off
      by the Count&mdash;rescues her&mdash;marries her&mdash;and then the
      virtuous mother confesses that the Prince is her own child, and Marie is
      the heiress to the throne. No one appeared to dispute the story&mdash;Marie
      is consequently Queen and her husband King, having through his proper
      treatment of the girl gained the kingdom; and the curtain falls on general
      happiness, Count Rodolph having committed suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could have been more successful,&rdquo; said Lottie, all tremulous with
      excitement, to Oswin, as they went off together amid a tumult of applause,
      which was very sweet to her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it went off very well indeed,&rdquo; said Oswin. &ldquo;Your acting was
      perfection, Miss Vincent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me Marie,&rdquo; she said playfully. &ldquo;But we must really go before the
      curtain; hear how they are applauding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we have had enough of it,&rdquo; said Oswin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I dislike it above all things, but there is
      nothing for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The call for Lottie and Oswin was determined, so after the soldiers had
      called out their favourite officers, Oswin brought the girl forward, and
      the enthusiasm was very great. Lottie then went off, and for a few moments
      Markham remained alone upon the stage. He was most heartily applauded,
      and, after acknowledging the compliment, he was just stepping back, when
      from the centre of the seats a man's voice came, loud and clear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, old boy! you're a trump wherever you turn up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general moving of heads, and some laughter in the front rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Oswin Markham looked from where he was standing on the stage down to
      the place whence that voice seemed to come. He neither laughed nor smiled,
      only stepped back behind the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage was now crowded with the actors and their friends; everybody was
      congratulating everybody else. Lottie was in the highest spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could anything have been more successful?&rdquo; she cried again to Oswin
      Markham. He looked at her without answering for some moments. &ldquo;I don't
      know,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Successful? perhaps so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;are you afraid of the Natal
      critics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't say I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a person at the door who wishes to speak to you, Mr. Markham,&rdquo;
       said one of the servants coming up to Oswin. &ldquo;He says he doesn't carry
      cards, but you will see his name here,&rdquo; and he handed Oswin an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswin Markham read the name on the envelope and crushed it into his
      pocket, saying to the servant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show the&mdash;gentleman up to the room where I dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Miss Lottie did not become aware of the origin of Mr. Markham's doubt
      as to the success of the great drama <i>Throne or Spouse</i>.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the room where
      he had assumed the dress of the part he had just played, Oswin Markham was
      now standing idle, and without making any attempt to remove the colour
      from his face or the streaks from his eyebrows. He was still in the dress
      of the Prince when the door was opened and a man entered the room eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jingo! yes, I thought you'd see me,&rdquo; he cried before he had closed the
      door. All the people outside&mdash;and there were a good many&mdash;who
      chanced to hear the tone of the voice knew that the speaker was the man
      who had shouted those friendly words when Oswin was leaving the stage.
      &ldquo;Yes, old fellow,&rdquo; he continued, slapping Markham on the back and grasping
      him by the hand, &ldquo;I thought I might venture to intrude upon you. Right
      glad I was to see you, though, by heavens! I thought I should have shouted
      out when I saw you&mdash;you, of all people, here. Tell us how it comes,
      Oswin. How the deuce do you appear at this place? Why, what's the matter
      with you? Have you talked so much in that tall way on the boards that you
      haven't a word left to say here? You weren't used to be dumb in the good
      old days&mdash;-good old nights, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't give me a chance,&rdquo; said Oswin; and he did not even smile in
      response to the other's laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There then, I've dried up,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;But, by my soul, I tell
      you I'm glad to see you. It seems to me, do you know, that I'm drunk now,
      and that when I sleep off the fit you'll be gone. I've fancied queer
      things when I've been drunk, as you well know. But it's you yourself,
      isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One need have no doubt about your identity,&rdquo; said Oswin. &ldquo;You talk in the
      same infernally muddled way that ever Harry Despard used to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's like yourself, my boy,&rdquo; cried the man, with a loud laugh. &ldquo;I'm
      beginning to feel that it's you indeed, though you are dressed up like a
      Prince&mdash;by heavens! you played the part well. I couldn't help
      shouting out what I did for a lark. I wondered what you'd think when you
      heard my voice. But how did you manage to turn up at Natal? tell me that.
      You left us to go up country, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a long story,&rdquo; replied Oswin. &ldquo;Very long, and I am bound to change
      this dress. I can't go about in this fashion for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more you can,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;And the sooner you get rid of those
      togs the better, for by God, it strikes me that they give you a wrong
      impression about yourself. You're not so hearty by a long way as you used
      to be. I'll tell you what I'll do; I'll go on to the hotel and wait there
      until you are in decent rig. I'll only be in this town until to-morrow
      evening, and we must have a night together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since the man had entered the room Oswin brightened up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only till to-morrow night, Hal?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Then we must have a few jolly
      hours together before we part. I won't let you even go to the hotel now.
      Stay here while I change, like a decent fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that sounds like your old form, my boy; hang me if I don't stay with
      you. Is that a flask in the portmanteau? It is, by Jingo, and if it's not
      old Irish may I be&mdash;and cigars too. Yes, I will stay, old fellow, for
      auld langsyne. This is like auld langsyne, isn't it? Why, where are you
      off to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to give a message to some one in another room,&rdquo; said Oswin,
      leaving the man alone. He was a tall man, apparently about the same age as
      Markham. So much of his face as remained unconcealed by a shaggy, tawny
      beard and whiskers was bronzed to a copper colour. His hair was short and
      tawny, and his mouth was very coarse. His dress was not shabby, but the
      largeness of the check on the pattern scarcely argued the possession of a
      subdued taste on the part of the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seated himself upon a table in the room though there were plenty of
      chairs, and when Oswin went out he filled the flask cup and emptied it
      with a single jerk of his head; then he snatched up the hat which had been
      worn by Oswin on the stage; he threw it into the air and caught it on one
      of his feet, then with a laugh he kicked it across the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Oswin had gone to the room where Captain Howard, who had acted as
      stage manager, was smoking after the labours of the evening. &ldquo;Howard,&rdquo;
       Said Markham, &ldquo;I must be excused from your supper to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Howard. &ldquo;It would be too ridiculous for us to have a
      supper if you who have done the most work to-night should be away. What's
      the matter? Have you a doctor's certificate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is a&mdash;a&mdash;sort of friend of mine&mdash;a man I knew
      pretty intimately some time ago, has turned up here most unexpectedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then bring your sort of friend with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite impossible,&rdquo; said Markham quickly. &ldquo;He is not the kind of man who
      would make the supper agreeable either to himself or to any one else. You
      will explain to the other fellows how I am compelled to be away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll turn up some time in the course of the night, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid to say I shall. The fact is, my friend requires a good deal
      of attention to be given to him in the course of a friendly night. If I
      can manage to clear myself of him in decent time I'll be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must manage it,&rdquo; said Howard as Oswin went back to the room, where he
      found his friend struggling to pull on the green doublet in which the
      Prince had appeared in the opening scene of the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang me if I couldn't do the part like one o'clock,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;the half
      of it is in the togs. You weren't loud enough, Oswin, when you came on;
      you wouldn't have brought down the gods even at Ballarat. This is how you
      should have done it: 'I'll save you or&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake don't make a fool of yourself, Hal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only going to show you how it should be done to rouse the people;
      and as for making a fool of myself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done that so often you think it not worth the caution. Come now,
      stuff those things into the portmanteau, and I'll have on my mufti in five
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then off to the hotel, and you bet your pile, as we used to say at
      Chokeneck Gulch, we'll have more than a pint bottle of Bass. By the way,
      how about your bronze; does the good old governor still stump up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My allowance goes regularly to Australia,&rdquo; said Os win, with a stern look
      coming to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where else should it go, my boy? By the way, that's a tidy female
      that showed what neat ankles she had as Marie. By my soul, I envied you
      squeezing her. 'What right has he to squeeze her?' I said to myself, and
      then I thought if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't told me how you came here,&rdquo; said Oswin, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more I did. It's easily told, my lad. It was getting too warm for me
      in Melbourne, and as I had still got some cash I thought I'd take a run to
      New York city&mdash;at least that's what I made up my mind to do when I
      awoke one fine morning in the cabin of the <i>Virginia</i> brig a couple
      of hundred miles from Cape Howe. I remembered going into a saloon one
      evening and finding a lot of men giving general shouts, but beyond that I
      had no idea of anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's your usual form,&rdquo; said Oswin. &ldquo;So you are bound for New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the skipper of the <i>Virginia</i> had made Natal one of his ports,
      and there we put in yesterday, so I ran up to this town, under what you
      would call an inspiration, or I wouldn't be here now ready to slip the
      tinsel from as many bottles of genuine Moët as you choose to order. But
      you&mdash;what about yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, my Hal, to order as many bottles as you can slip the tinsel
      off,&rdquo; cried Oswin, his face flushed more deeply than when it had been
      rouged before the footlights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken in your old form, by heavens!&rdquo; cried the other, leaping from the
      table. &ldquo;You always were a gentleman amongst us, and you never failed us in
      the matter of drink. Hang me if I don't let the <i>Virginia</i> brig&mdash;go&mdash;to&mdash;to
      New York without me; I'll stay here in company of my best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Oswin, leaving the room. &ldquo;Whether you go or stay we'll
      have a night of it at the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed out together and walked up to the hotel, hearing all the white
      population discussing the dramatic performance of the evening, for it had
      created a considerable stir in the town. There was no moon, but the stars
      were sparkling over the dark blue of the hills that almost encircle the
      town. Tall Zulus stood, as they usually do after dark, talking at the
      corners in their emphatic language, while here and there smaller white men
      speaking Cape Dutch passed through the streets smoking their native
      cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what you would find in Melbourne or in the direction of Geelong,
      isn't it, Oswin?&rdquo; said the stranger, who had his arm inside Markham's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with a few modifications,&rdquo; said Oswin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hang it all, man,&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;You aren't getting sentimental,
      are you? A fellow would think from the way you've been talking in that
      low, hollow, parson's tone that you weren't glad I turned up. If you're
      not, just say so. You won't need to give Harry Despard a nod after you've
      given him a wink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an infernal fool you do make of yourself,&rdquo; said Oswin. &ldquo;You know
      that I'm glad to have you beside me again, old fellow,&mdash;yes, devilish
      glad. Confound it, man, do you fancy I've no feeling&mdash;no
      recollection? Haven't we stood by each other in the past, and won't we do
      it in the future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will, by heavens, my lad! and hang me if I don't smash anything that
      comes on the table tonight except the sparkling. And look here, the <i>Virginia</i>
      brig may slip her cable and be off to New York. I'll stand by you while
      you stay here, my boy. Yes, say no more, my mind is made up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken like a man!&rdquo; cried Oswin, with a sudden start. &ldquo;Spoken like a man!
      and here we are at the hotel. We'll have one of our old suppers together,
      Hal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perish in the attempt,&rdquo; shouted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger went upstairs, while Oswin remained below to talk to the
      landlord about some matters that occupied a little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markham and Harwood had a sitting-room for their exclusive use in the
      hotel, but it was not into this room that Oswin brought his guest, it was
      into another apartment at a different quarter of the house. The stranger
      threw his hat into a corner and himself down upon a sofa with his legs
      upon a chair that he had tilted back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we'll have a general shout,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ask all the people in the
      house what they'll drink. If you acted the Prince on the stage to-night,
      I'll act the part here now. I've got the change of a hundred samples of
      the Sydney mint, and I want to ease myself of them. Yes, we'll have a
      general shout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A general shout in a Dutchman's house? My boy, this isn't a Ballarat
      saloon,&rdquo; said Oswin. &ldquo;If we hinted such a thing we'd be turned into the
      street. Here is a bottle of the sparkling by way of opening the campaign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll open the champagne and you open the campaign, good! The sight of
      you, Oswin, old fellow&mdash;well, it makes me feel that life is a joke.
      Fill up your glass and we'll drink to the old times. And now tell me all
      about yourself. How did you light here, and what do you mean to do? Have
      you had another row in the old quarter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswin had drained his glass of champagne and had stretched himself upon
      the second sofa. His face seemed pale almost to ghastliness, as persons'
      faces do after the use of rouge. He gave a short laugh when the other had
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till after supper,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I haven't a word to throw to a dog
      until after supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse that Prince and his bluster on the stage; you're as hoarse as a
      rook now, Oswin,&rdquo; remarked the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a brief space the curried crayfish and penguins' eggs, which form the
      opening dishes of a Cape supper, appeared; and though Oswin's friend
      seemed to have an excellent appetite, Markham himself scarcely ate
      anything. It did not, however, appear that the stranger's comfort was
      wholly dependent upon companionship. He ate and drank and talked loudly
      whether Oswin fasted or remained mute; but when the supper was removed and
      he lighted a cigar, he poured out half a bottle of champagne into a
      tumbler, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my gallant Prince, give us all your eventful history since you left
      Melbourne five months ago, saying you were going up country. Tell us how
      you came to this place, whatever its infernal Dutch name is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Oswin Markham, sitting at the table, told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while this <i>tète-à-tète</i> supper was taking place at the hotel,
      the messroom of the Bayonetteers was alight, and the regimental cook had
      excelled himself in providing dishes that were wholly English, without the
      least colonial flavour, for the officers and their guests, among whom was
      Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Howard's apology for Markham was not freely accepted, more
      especially as Markham did not put in an appearance during the entire of
      the supper. Harwood was greatly surprised at his absence, and the story of
      a friend having suddenly turned up he rejected as a thing devised as an
      excuse. He did not return to the hotel until late&mdash;more than an hour
      past midnight. He paused outside the hotel door for some moments, hearing
      the sound of loud laughter and a hoarse voice singing snatches of
      different songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the noisy party upstairs?&rdquo; he asked of the man who opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Mr. Markham and his friend, sir. They have taken supper
      together,&rdquo; said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harwood did not express the surprise he felt. He took his candle, and went
      to his own room, and, as he smoked a cigar before going to bed, he heard
      the intermittent sounds of the laughter and the singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have a talk with this old friend of Mr. Markham's in the
      morning,&rdquo; he said, after he had stated another of his problems to sleep
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markham and he had been accustomed to breakfast together in their
      sitting-room since they had come up from Durban; but when Harwood awoke
      the next morning, and came in to breakfast, he found only one cup upon the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is there not a cup for Mr. Markham?&rdquo; he asked of the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Markham, sir, left with his friend for Durban at four o'clock this
      morning,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, for Durban?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. Markham had ordered a Cape cart and team to be here at that
      time. I thought you might have awakened as they were leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood quietly; and the servant left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was something additional for the special correspondent of the <i>Dominant
      Trumpeter</i> to ponder over and reduce to the terms of a problem. He
      reflected upon his early suspicions of Oswin Markham. Had he not even
      suggested that Markham's name was probably something very different from
      what he had called himself? Mr. Harwood knew well that men have a curious
      tendency to call themselves by the names of the persons to whom bank
      orders are made payable, and he believed that such a subtle sympathy might
      exist between the man who had been picked up at sea and the document that
      was found in his possession. Yes, Mr. Harwood felt that his instincts were
      not perhaps wholly in error regarding Mr. Oswin Markham, cleverly though
      he had acted the part of the Prince in that stirring drama on the previous
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the following day, however, Oswin Markham entered the
      hotel at Pietermaritzburg and walked into the room where Harwood was
      working up a letter for his newspaper, descriptive of life among the
      Zulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried the &ldquo;special,&rdquo; starting up; &ldquo;I did not expect you
      back so soon. Why, you could only have stayed a few hours at the port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was enough for me,&rdquo; said Oswin, a smile lighting up his pale face;
      &ldquo;quite enough for me. I only waited to see the vessel with my friend
      aboard safely over the bar. Then I returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went away from here in something of a hurry, did you not, Markham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswin laughed as he threw himself into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, something of a hurry. My friend is&mdash;let us say, eccentric. We
      left without going to bed the night before last. Never mind, Harwood, old
      fellow; he is gone, and here I am now, ready for anything you propose&mdash;an
      excursion across the Tugela or up to the Transvaal&mdash;anywhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;I'm
      free now and myself again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free?&rdquo; said Harwood curiously. &ldquo;What do you mean by free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswin looked at him mutely for a moment, then he laughed, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free&mdash;yes, free from that wretched dramatic affair. Thank Heaven,
      it's off my mind!&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y son,&rdquo; said The
      Macnamara, &ldquo;you ought to be ashamed of your threatment of your father. The
      like of your threatment was never known in the family of the Macnamaras,
      or, for that matter, of the O'Dermots. A stain has been thrown upon the
      family that centuries can't wash out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no stain either upon myself or our family for me to have set out to
      do some work in the world,&rdquo; said Standish proudly, for he felt capable of
      maintaining the dignity of labour. &ldquo;I told you that I would not pass my
      life in the idleness of Innishdermot. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too much for me, Standish O'Dermot Macnamara&mdash;to hear you talk
      lightly of Innishdermot is too much for the blood of the representative of
      the ancient race. Don't, my boy, don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't talk lightly of it; when you told me it was gone from us I felt
      it as deeply as any one could feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's one more wrong added to the grievances of our thrampled counthry,&rdquo;
       cried the hereditary monarch of the islands with fervour. &ldquo;And yet you
      have never sworn an oath to be revenged. You even tell me that you mean to
      be in the pay of the nation that has done your family this wrong&mdash;that
      has thrampled The Macnamara into the dust. This is the bitterest stroke of
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you all,&rdquo; said Standish. &ldquo;Colonel Gerald was kinder to me
      than words could express. He is going to England in two months, but only
      to remain a week, and then he will leave for the Castaway Islands. He has
      already written to have my appointment as private secretary confirmed, and
      I shall go at once to have everything ready for his arrival. It's not much
      I can do, God knows, but what I can do I will for him. I'll work my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is bitter&mdash;bitter&mdash;to hear a Macnamara talk of work;
      and just now, too, when the money has come to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want the money,&rdquo; said Standish indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye're right, my son, so far. What signifies fifteen thousand pounds when
      the feelings of an ancient family are outraged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't understand how those men had power to take the land, if you
      did not wish to give it to them, for their railway and their hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's more of the oppression, my son&mdash;more of the thrampling of our
      counthry into the dust. I rejected their offers with scorn at first; but I
      found out that they could get power from the oppressors of our counthry to
      buy every foot of the ground at the price put on it by a man they call an
      arbithrator&mdash;so between thraitors and arbithrators I knew I couldn't
      hold out. With tears in my eyes I signed the papers, and now all the land
      from the mouth of Suangorm to Innishdermot is in the hands of the English
      company&mdash;all but the castle&mdash;thank God they couldn't wrest that
      from me. If you'd only been by me, Standish, I would have held out against
      them all; but think of the desolate old man sitting amongst the ruins of
      his home and the tyrants with the gold&mdash;I could do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you came out here. Well, father, I'm glad to see you, and
      Colonel Gerald will be so too, and&mdash;Daireen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said The Macnamara. &ldquo;Daireen is here too. And have you been talking
      to the lovely daughter of the Geralds, my boy? Have you been confessing
      all you confessed to me, on that bright day at Innishdermot? Have you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, father,&rdquo; said Standish sternly; &ldquo;you must never allude to
      anything that you forced me to say then. It was a dream of mine, and now
      it is past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hold your head higher than that now, my boy,&rdquo; said The Macnamara
      proudly. &ldquo;You're not a beggar now, Standish; money's in the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if money could make any difference,&rdquo; said Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes all the difference in the world, my boy,&rdquo; said The Macnamara;
      but suddenly recollecting his principles, he added, &ldquo;That is, to some
      people; but a Macnamara without a penny might aspire to the hand of the
      noblest in the land. Oh, here she comes&mdash;the bright snowdhrop of
      Glenmara&mdash;the arbutus-berry of Craig-Innish; and her father too&mdash;oh,
      why did he turn to the Saxons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Macnamara, Prince of Innishdermot, Chief of the Islands and Lakes, and
      King of all Munster, was standing with his son in the coffee-room of the
      hotel, having just come ashore from the steamer that had brought him out
      to the Cape. The patriot had actually left his land for the first time in
      his life, and had proceeded to the colony in search of his son, and he
      found his son waiting for him at the dock gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      That first letter which Standish received from his father had indeed been
      very piteous, and if the young man had not been so resolute in his
      determination to work, he would have returned to Innishdermot once more,
      to comfort his father in his trials. But the next mail brought a second
      communication from The Macnamara to say that he could endure no longer the
      desolation of the lonely hearth of his ancestral castle, but would set out
      in search of his lost offspring through all the secret places of the
      earth. Considering that he had posted this letter to the definite address
      of his offspring, the effect of the vagueness of his expressed resolution
      was somewhat lessened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standish received the letter with dismay, and Colonel Gerald himself felt
      a little uneasiness at the prospect of having The Macnamara quartered upon
      him for an uncertain period. He was well aware of the largeness of the
      ideas of The Macnamara on many matters, and in regard to the question of
      colonial hospitality he felt that the views of the hereditary prince would
      be liberal to an inconvenient degree. It was thus with something akin to
      consternation that he listened to the eloquent letter which Standish read
      with flushed face and trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be very pleased to see The Macnamara here,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald;
      and Daireen laughed, saying she could not believe that Standish's father
      would ever bring himself to depart from his kingdom. It was on the next
      day that Colonel Gerald had an interview of considerable duration with
      Standish on a matter of business, he said; and when it was over and the
      young man's qualifications had been judged of, Standish found himself in a
      position either to accept or decline the office of private secretary to
      the new governor of the lovely Castaway group. With tears he left the
      presence of the governor, and went to his room to weep the fulness from
      his mind and to make a number of firm resolutions as to his future of hard
      work; and that very evening Colonel Gerald had written to the Colonial
      Office nominating Standish to the appointment; so that the matter was
      considered settled, and Standish felt that he did not fear to face his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Standish had met The Macnamara on the arrival of the mail steamer
      a week after he had received that letter stating his intentions, the young
      man learned, what apparently could not be included in a letter without
      proving harassing to its eloquence, that the extensive lands along the
      coastway of the lough had been sold to an English company of speculators
      who had come to the conclusion that a railway made through the picturesque
      district would bring a fortune to every one who might be so fortunate as
      to have money invested in the undertaking. So a railway was to be made,
      and a gigantic hotel built to overlook the lough. The shooting and fishing
      rights&mdash;in fact every right and every foot of ground, had been sold
      for a large sum to the company by The Macnamara. And though Standish had
      at first felt the news as a great blow to him, he subsequently became
      reconciled to it, for his father's appearance at the Cape with several
      thousand pounds was infinitely more pleasing to him than if the
      representative of The Macnamaras had come in his former condition, which
      was simply one of borrowing powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the snowdhrop of Glenmara,&rdquo; said The Macnamara, kissing the hand of
      Daireen as he met her at the door of the room. &ldquo;And you, George, my boy,&rdquo;
       he continued, turning to her father; &ldquo;I may shake hands with you as a
      friend, without the action being turned to mean that I forgive the
      threatment my counthry has received from the nation whose pay you are
      still in. Yes, only as a friend I shake hands with you, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a sufficient ground for me, Macnamara,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;We
      won't go into the other matters just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot believe that this is Cape Town,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;Just think of
      our meeting here to-day. Oh, if we could only have a glimpse of the dear
      old Slieve Docas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't you see it, white dove?&rdquo; said The Macnamara in Irish to the
      girl, whose face brightened at the sound of the tongue that brought back
      so many pleasant recollections to her. &ldquo;Why shouldn't you?&rdquo; he continued,
      taking from one of the boxes of his luggage an immense bunch of purple
      heather in gorgeous bloom. &ldquo;I gathered it for you from the slope of the
      mountain. It brings you the scent of the finest hill in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl caught the magnificent bloom in both her hands and put her face
      down to it. As the first breath of the hill she loved came to her in this
      strange land they saw her face lighten. Then she turned away and buried
      her head in the scents of the hills&mdash;in the memories of the mountains
      and the lakes, while The Macnamara spoke on in the musical tongue that
      lived in her mind associated with all the things of the land she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Innishdermot,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald at length, &ldquo;how is the seat of our
      kings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my counthry! thrampled on&mdash;bethrayed&mdash;crushed to the
      ground!&rdquo; said The Macnamara. &ldquo;You won't believe it, George&mdash;no, you
      won't. They have spoiled me of all I possessed&mdash;they have driven me
      out of the counthry that my sires ruled when the oppressors were walking
      about in the skins of wild beasts. Yes, George, Innishdermot is taken from
      me and I've no place to shelter me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gerald began to look grave and to feel much graver even than he
      looked. The Macnamara shelterless was certainly a subject for serious
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Standish, observing the expression on his face, &ldquo;you would
      wonder how any company could find it profitable to pay fifteen thousand
      pounds for the piece of land. That is what the new railway people paid my
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the colonel's face brightened, but The Macnamara stood up
      proudly, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pounds! What are pounds to the feelings of a true patriot? What can money
      do to heal the wrongs of a race?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the colonel; &ldquo;nothing whatever. But we must hasten out to
      our cottage. I'll get a coolie to take your luggage to the railway
      station. We shall drive out. My dear Dolly, come down from yonder mountain
      height where you have gone on wings of heather. I'll take out the bouquet
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;I'll not let any one carry it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they all went out of the hotel to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>maître d'hôtel</i>, who had been listening to the speech of The
      Macnamara in wonder, and had been finally mystified by the Celtic
      language, hastened to the visitors' book in which The Macnamara had
      written his name; but this last step certainly did not tend to make
      everything clear, for in the book was written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Macnamara, Prince of the Isles, Chief of Innish-dermot and the Lakes, and
      King of Munster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with such a nose!&rdquo; said the <i>maître d'hôtel</i>.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O these four
      exiles from Erin sitting out on the stoep of the Dutch cottage after
      dinner very sweet it was to dream of fatherland. The soft light through
      which the broad-leaved, motionless plants glimmered was, of course, not to
      be compared with the long dwindling twilights that were wont to overhang
      the slopes of Lough Suangorm; and that mighty peak which towered above
      them, flanked by the long ridge of Table Mountain, was a poor thing in the
      eyes of those who had witnessed the glories of the heather-swathed Slieve
      Docas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cries ot the bullock wagoners, which were faintly heard from the road,
      did not interfere with the musings of any of the party, nor with the
      harangue of The Macnamara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very pleasant it was to hear The Macnamara talk about his homeless
      condition as attributable to the long course of oppression persisted in by
      the Saxon Monarchy&mdash;at least so Colonel Gerald thought, for in a
      distant colony a harangue on the subject of British tyranny in Ireland
      does not sound very vigorous, any more than does a burning revolutionary
      ode when read a century or so after the revolution has taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But poor Standish, who had spent a good many years of his life breathing
      in of the atmosphere of harangue, began to feel impatient at his sire's
      eloquence. Standish knew very well that his father had made a hard bargain
      with the railway and hotel company that had bought the land; nay, he even
      went so far as to conjecture that the affectionate yearning which had
      caused The Macnamara to come out to the colony in search of his son might
      be more plainly defined as an impulse of prudence to escape from certain
      of his creditors before they could hear of his having received a large sum
      of money. Standish wondered how Colonel Gerald could listen to all that
      his father was saying when he could not help being conscious of the
      nonsense of it all, for the young man was not aware of the pleasant
      memories of his youth that were coming back to the colonel under the
      influence of The Macnamara's speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, however, Standish had a conversation of considerable length
      with his father, and The Macnamara found that he had made rapid progress
      in his knowledge of the world since he had left his secluded home. In the
      face of his father he insisted on his father's promising to remove from
      the Dutch cottage at the end of a few days. The Macnamara's notions of
      hospitality were very large, and he could not see why Colonel Gerald
      should have the least feeling except of happiness in entertaining a
      shelterless monarch; but Standish was firm, and Colonel Gerald did not
      resist so stoutly as The Macnamara felt he should have done; so that at
      the end of the week Daireen and her father were left alone for the first
      time since they had come together at the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found it very agreeable to be able to sit together and ride together
      and talk without reserve. Standish Macnamara was, beyond doubt, very good
      company, and his father was even more inclined to be sociable, but no one
      disputed the wisdom of the young man's conduct in curtailing his visit and
      his father's to the Dutch cottage. The Macnamara had his pockets filled
      with money, and as Standish knew that this was a strange experience for
      him, he resolved that the weight of responsibility which the preservation
      of so large a sum was bound to entail, should be reduced; so he took a
      cottage at Rondebosch for his father and himself, and even went the length
      of buying a horse. The lordliness of the ideas of the young man who had
      only had a few months' experience of the world greatly impressed his
      father, and he paid for everything without a murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standish had, at the intervals of his father's impassioned discourses,
      many a long and solitary ride and many a lengthened reverie amongst the
      pines that grow beside The Flats. The resolutions he made as to his life
      at the Castaway group were very numerous, and the visions that floated
      before his eyes were altogether very agreeable. He was beginning to feel
      that he had accomplished a good deal of that ennobling hard work in the
      world which he had resolved to set about fulfilling. His previous
      resolutions had not been made carelessly: he had grappled with adverse
      Fate, he felt, and was he not getting the better of this contrary power?
    </p>
    <p>
      But not many days after the arrival of The Macnamara another personage of
      importance made his appearance in Cape Town. The Bishop of the Calapash
      Islands and Metropolitan of the Salamander Archipelago had at last found a
      vessel to convey him to where his dutiful son was waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prelate felt that he had every reason to congratulate himself upon the
      opportuneness of his arrival, for Mr. Glaston assured his father, after
      the exuberance of their meeting had passed away, that if the vessel had
      not appeared within the course of another week, he would have been
      compelled to defer the gratification of his filial desires for another
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A colony is endurable for a week,&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston; &ldquo;it is wearisome at
      the end of a fortnight; but a month spent with colonists has got a
      demoralising effect that years perhaps may fail to obliterate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bishop felt that indeed he had every reason to be thankful that
      unfavourable winds had not prolonged the voyage of his vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford was, naturally enough, one of the first persons at the Cape
      to visit the bishop, for she had known him years before&mdash;she had
      indeed known most Colonial celebrities in her time&mdash;and she took the
      opportunity to explain to him that Colonel Gerald had been counting the
      moments until the arrival of the vessel from the Salamanders, so great was
      his anxiety to meet with the Metropolitan of that interesting archipelago,
      with whom he had been acquainted a good many years before. This was very
      gratifying to the bishop, who liked to be remembered by his friends; he
      had an idea that even the bishop of a distant colony runs a chance of
      being forgotten in the world unless he has written an heretical book, so
      he was glad when, a few days after his arrival at Cape Town, he received a
      visit from Colonel Gerald and an invitation to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was very pleasing to Mrs. Crawford, for, of course, Algernon Glaston
      was included in the invitation, and she contrived without any difficulty
      that he should be seated by the side of Miss Gerald. Her skill was amply
      rewarded, she felt, when she observed Mr. Glaston and Daireen engaged in
      what sounded like a discussion on the musical landscapes of Liszt; to be
      engaged&mdash;even on a discussion of so subtle a nature&mdash;was
      something, Mrs. Crawford thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this evening, she herself, while the bishop was smiling
      upon Daireen in a way that had gained the hearts, if not the souls, of the
      Salamanderians, got by the side of Mr. Glaston, intent upon following up
      the advantage the occasion offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad that the bishop has taken a fancy to Daireen,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Daireen is a dear good girl&mdash;is she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Glaston raised his eyebrows and touched the extreme point of his
      moustache before he answered a question so pronounced. &ldquo;Ah, she is&mdash;improving,&rdquo;
       he said slowly. &ldquo;If she leaves this place at once she may improve still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants some one to be near her capable of moulding her tastes&mdash;don't
      you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>needs</i> such a one. I should not like to say <i>wants,</i>&rdquo;
       remarked Mr. Glaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure Daireen would be very willing to learn, Mr. Glaston; she
      believes in you, I know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, who was proceeding on an
      assumption of the broad principles she had laid down to Daireen regarding
      the effect of flattery upon the race. But her words did not touch Mr.
      Glaston deeply: he was accustomed to be believed in by girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has taste&mdash;some taste,&rdquo; he replied, though the concession was
      not forced from him by Mrs. Crawford's revelation to him. &ldquo;Yes; but of
      what value is taste unless it is educated upon the true principles of
      Art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Gerald's taste is as yet only approaching the right tracks of
      culture. One shudders, anticipating the effect another month of life in
      such a place as this may have upon her. For my own part, I do not suppose
      that I shall be myself again for at least a year after I return. I feel my
      taste utterly demoralised through the two months of my stay here; and I
      explained to my father that it will be necessary for him to resign his see
      if he wishes to have me near him at all. It is quite impossible for me to
      come out here again. The three months' absence from England that my visit
      entails is ruinous to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always thought of your self-sacrifice as an example of true filial
      duty, Mr. Glaston. I know that Daireen thinks so as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Glaston did not seem particularly anxious to talk of Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; my father must resign his see,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The month I have just passed has left too terrible recollections behind
      it to allow of my running a chance of its being repeated. The only person
      I met in the colony who was not hopelessly astray was that Miss Vincent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford, almost shocked. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Glaston! you surely do
      not mean that! Good gracious!&mdash;Lottie Vincent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Vincent was the only one who, I found, had any correct idea of Art;
      and yet, you see, how she turned out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned out? I should think so indeed. Lottie Vincent was always turning
      out since the first time I met her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the idea of her acting in company of such a man as this Markham&mdash;a
      man who had no hesitation in going to view a picture by candlelight&mdash;it
      is too distressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Glaston, I think they will get on very well together. You do
      not know Lottie Vincent as I know her. She has behaved with the most
      shocking ingratitude towards me. But we are parted now, and I shall take
      good care she does not impose upon me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It scarcely matters how one's social life is conducted if one's artistic
      life is correct,&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this assertion, which she should have known to be one of the articles
      of Mr. Glaston's creed, Mrs. Crawford gave a little start. She thought it
      better, however, not to question its soundness. As a matter of fact, the
      bishop himself, if he had heard his son enunciate such a precept, would
      not have questioned its soundness; for Mr. Glaston spake as one having
      authority, and most people whose robustness was not altogether mental,
      believed his Gospel of Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt what you say is&mdash;ah&mdash;very true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford.
      &ldquo;But I do wish, Mr. Glaston, that you could find time to talk frequently
      to Daireen on these subjects. I should be so sorry if the dear child's
      ideas were allowed to run wild. Your influence might work wonders with
      her. There is no one here now who can interfere with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interfere with me, Mrs. Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, you know, that Mr. Harwood, with his meretricious cleverness,
      might possibly&mdash;ah&mdash;well, you know how easily girls are led.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there would be a possibility of Miss Gerald's being influenced in a
      single point by such a man as that Mr. Harwood, I fear not much can be
      hoped for her,&rdquo; said Mr. Glaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should never be without hope,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford. &ldquo;For my own part, I
      hope a great deal&mdash;a very great deal&mdash;from your influence over
      Daireen; and I am exceedingly happy that the bishop seems so pleased with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good bishop was indeed distributing his benedictory smiles freely, and
      Daireen came in for a share of his favours. Her father wondered at the
      prodigality of the churchman's smiles; for as a chaplain he was not wont
      to be anything but grave. The colonel did not reflect that while smiling
      may be a grievous fault in a chaplain, it can never be anything but
      ornamental to a bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards Mrs. Crawford called upon the bishop, and had an
      interesting conversation with him on the subject of his son's future&mdash;a
      question to which of late the bishop himself had given a good deal of
      thought; for in the course of his official investigations on the question
      of human existence he had been led to believe that the duration of life
      has at all times been uncertain; he had more than once communicated this
      fact to dusky congregations, and by reducing the application of the
      painful truth, he had come to feel that the life of even a throned bishop
      is not exempt from the fatalities of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the bishop's son was accustomed to spend half of the revenues of his
      father's see, his father was beginning to have an anxiety about the future
      of the young man; for he did not think that his successor to the prelacy
      of the Calapash Islands would allow Mr. Glaston to draw, as usual, upon
      the income accruing to the office. The bishop was not so utterly unworldly
      in his notions but that he knew there exist other means of amassing wealth
      than by writing verses in a pamphlet-magazine, or even composing delicate
      impromptus in minor keys for one's own hearing, His son had not felt it
      necessary to occupy his mind with any profession, so that his future was
      somewhat difficult to foresee with any degree of clearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford, however, spoke many comforting words to the bishop
      regarding a provision for his son's future. Daireen Gerald, she assured
      him, besides being one of the most charming girls in the world, was the
      only child of her father, and her father's estates in the South of Ireland
      were extensive and profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Crawford left him, the bishop felt glad that he had smiled so
      frequently upon Miss Gerald. He had heard that no kindly smile was
      bestowed in vain, but the truth of the sentiment had never before so
      forced itself upon his mind. He smiled again in recollection of his
      previous smiles. He felt that indeed Miss Gerald was a charming girl, and
      Mrs. Crawford was most certainly a wonderful woman; and it can scarcely be
      doubted that the result of the bishop's reflections proved the possession
      on his part of powerful mental resources, enabling him to arrive at subtle
      conclusions on questions of perplexity.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>TANDISH Macnamara
      had ridden to the Dutch cottage, but he found it deserted. Colonel Gerald,
      one of the servants informed him, had early in the day driven to Simon's
      Town, and had taken Miss Gerald with him, but they would both return in
      the evening. Sadly the young man turned away, and it is to be feared that
      his horse had a hard time of it upon The Flats. The waste of sand was
      congenial with his mood, and so was the rapid motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while he was riding about in an aimless way, Daireen and her father
      were driving along the lovely road that runs at the base of the low hills
      which form a mighty causeway across the isthmus between Table Bay and
      Simon's Bay. Colonel Gerald had received a message that the man-of-war
      which had been stationed at the chief of the Castaway group had called at
      Simon's Bay; he was anxious to know how the provisional government was
      progressing under the commodore of those waters whose green monotony is
      broken by the gentle cliff's of the Castaways, and Daireen had been
      allowed to accompany her father to the naval station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer had not yet advanced sufficiently far to make tawny the dark
      green coarse herbage of the hillside, and the mass of rich colouring lent
      by the heaths and the prickly-pear hedges made Daireen almost jealous for
      the glories of the slopes of Glenmara. For some distance over the road the
      boughs of Australian oaks in heavy foilage were leaning; but when
      Constantia and its evenly set vineyards were passed some distance, Daireen
      heard the sound of breaking waves, and in an instant afterwards the road
      bore them down to the water's edge at Kalk Bay, a little rocky crescent
      enclosing green sparkling waves. Upon a pebbly beach a few fishing-boats
      were drawn up, and the outlying spaces were covered with drying nets, the
      flavour of which was much preferable to that of the drying fish that were
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      On still the road went until it lost itself upon the mighty beaches of
      False Bay. Down to the very brink of the great green waves that burst in
      white foam and clouds of mist upon the sand the team of the wagonette was
      driven, and on along the snowy curve for miles until Simon's Bay with its
      cliffs were reached, and the horses were pulled up at the hotel in the
      single street of Simon's Town at the base of the low ridge of the purple
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be lonely, Dolly,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald as he left the hotel
      after lunch to meet the commander of the man-of-war of which the
      yellow-painted hull and long streaming pennon could be seen from the
      window, opposite the fort at the farthest arm of the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonely?&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I hope I may, for I feel I would like a little
      loneliness for a change. I have not been lonely since I was at Glenmara
      listening to Murrough O'Brian playing a dirge. Run away now, papa, and you
      can tell me when we are driving home what the Castaways are really like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll make particular inquiries as to the possibilities of lawn-tennis,&rdquo;
       said her father, as he went down the steps to the red street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen saw a sergeant's party of soldiers carry arms to the colonel,
      though he wore no uniform and had not been at this place for years; but
      even less accustomed observers than the men would have known that he was a
      soldier. Tall, straight, and with bright gray eyes somewhat hollower than
      they had been twenty years before, he looked a soldier in every point&mdash;one
      who had served well and who had yet many years of service before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      How noble he looked, Daireen thought, as he kissed his hand up to her. And
      then she thought how truly great his life had been. Instead of coming home
      after his time of service had expired, he had continued at his post in
      India, unflinching beneath the glare of the sun overhead or from the
      scorching of the plain underfoot; and here he was now, not going home to
      rest for the remainder of his life, but ready to face an arduous duty on
      behalf of his country. She knew that he had been striving through all
      these years to forget in the work he was accomplishing the one grief of
      his life. She had often seen him gazing at her face, and she knew why he
      had sighed as he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not meant to feel lonely in her father's absence, but her thoughts
      somehow were not of that companionable kind which, coming to one when
      alone, prevent one's feeling lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up the visitors' book and read all the remarks that had been
      written in English for the past years; but even the literature of an hotel
      visitor's book fails at some moments to relieve a reader's mind. She
      turned over the other volumes, one of which was the Commercial Code of
      Signals, and the other a Dutch dictionary. She read one of Mr. Harwood's
      letters in a back number of the <i>Dominant Trumpeter</i>, and she found
      that she could easily recall the circumstances under which, in various
      conversations, he had spoken to her every word of that column and a
      quarter. She wondered if special correspondents write out every night all
      the remarks that they have heard during the day. But even the attempt to
      solve this problem did not make her feel brisk.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the thought which was hovering about her, and which she was
      trying to avoid by all the means in her power? She could not have defined
      it. The boundaries of that thought were too vague to be outlined by words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced out of the window for a while, and then walked to the door and
      looked over the iron balcony at the head of the steps. Only a few people
      were about the street. Gazing out seawards, she saw a signal flying from
      the peak of the man-of-war, and in a few minutes she saw a boat put off
      and row steadily for the shore near the far-off fort at the headland. She
      knew the boat was to convey her father aboard the vessel. She stood there
      watching it until it had landed and was on its way back with her father in
      the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went along the road until she had left the limits of the town,
      and was standing between the hill and the sea. Very lovely the sea looked
      from where it was breaking about the rocks beneath her, out to the horizon
      which was undefined in the delicate mist that rose from the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood for a long time tasting of the freshness of the breeze. She
      could see the man-of-war's boat making its way through the waves until it
      at last reached the ship, and then she seemed to have lost the object of
      her thoughts. She turned off the road and got upon the sloping beach along
      which she walked some distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had met no one since she had left the hotel, and the coast of the Bay
      round to the farthest headland seemed deserted; but somehow her mood of
      loneliness had gone from her as she stood at the brink of those waters
      whose music was as the sound of a song of home heard in a strange land.
      What was there to hinder her from thinking that she was standing at the
      uttermost headland of Lough Suangorm, looking out once more upon the
      Atlantic?
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed a sandy hollow and got upon a ledge of rocks, up to which the
      sea was beating. Here she seated herself, and sent her eyes out seawards
      to where the war-ship was lying, and then that thought which had been near
      her all the day came upon her. It was not of the Irish shore that the glad
      waters were laving. It was only of some words that had been spoken to her.
      &ldquo;For a month we will think of each other,&rdquo; were the words, and she
      reflected that now this month had passed. The month that she had promised
      to think of him had gone, but it had not taken with it her thoughts of the
      man who had uttered those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked out dreamily across the green waves, wondering if he had
      returned. Surely he would not let a day pass without coming to her side to
      ask her if she had thought of him during the month. And what answer would
      she give him? She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love, my love,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when have I ceased to think of you? When shall
      I cease to think of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears forced themselves into her eyes with the pure intensity of her
      passion. She sat there dreaming her dreams and thinking her thoughts until
      she seemed only to hear the sound of the waters of the distance; the sound
      of the breaking waves seemed to have passed away. It was this sudden
      consciousness that caused her to awake from her reverie. She turned and
      saw that the waves were breaking on the beach <i>behind her</i>&mdash;the
      rock where she was sitting was surrounded with water, and every plunge of
      the advancing tide sent a swirl of water through the gulf that separated
      the rocks from the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant she had started to her feet. She saw the death that was
      about her. She looked to the rock where she was standing. The highest,
      ledge contained a barnacle. She knew it was below the line of high water,
      and now not more than a couple of feet of the ledge were uncovered. A
      little cry of horror burst from her, and at the same instant the boom of a
      gun came across the water from the man-of-war; she looked and saw that the
      boat was on its way to the shore again. In another half-minute a second
      report sounded, and she knew that they were firing a salute to her father.
      They were doing this while his daughter was gazing at death in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could they see her from the boat? It seemed miles away, but she took off
      her white jacket and standing up waved it. Not the least sign was made
      from the boat. The report of the guns echoed along the shore mingling with
      her cries. But a sign was given from the water: a wave flung its spray
      clear over the rock. She knew what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw in a moment what chance she had of escape. The water between the
      rock and the shore was not yet very deep. If she could bear the brunt of
      the wild rush of the waves that swept into the hollow she could make her
      way ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant she had stepped down to the water, still holding on by the
      rocks. A moment of stillness came and she rushed through the waves, but
      that sand&mdash;it sank beneath her first step, and she fell backwards,
      then came another swirl of eddying waves that plunged through the gulf and
      swept her away with their force, out past the rock she had been on. One
      cry she gave as she felt herself lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boom of the saluting gun doing honour to her father was the sound she
      heard as the cruel foam flashed into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at her cry there started up from behind a rock far ashore the figure
      of a man. He looked about him in a bewildered way. Then he made a rush for
      the beach, seeing the toy the waves were heaving about. He plunged in up
      to his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the sand!&rdquo; he cried, as he felt it yield. He bent himself against
      the current and took advantage of every relapse of the tide to rush a few
      steps onward. He caught the rock and swung himself round to the seaward
      side. Then he waited until the next wave brought that helpless form near
      him. He did not leave his hold of the rock, but before the backward sweep
      came he clutched the girl's dress. Then came a struggle between man and
      wave. The man conquered. He had the girl on one of his arms, and had
      placed her upon the rock for an instant. Then he swung himself to the
      shoreward side, caught her up again, and stumbling, and sinking, and
      battling with the current, he at last gained a sound footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen was exhausted but not insensible. She sat upon the dry sand where
      the man had placed her, and she drew back the wet hair from her face. Then
      she saw the man stand by the edge of the water and shake his fist at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not the first time I've licked you singlehanded,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
      it'll not be the last. Your bullying roar won't wash here.&rdquo; Then he seemed
      to catch sight of something on the top of a wave. &ldquo;Hang me if you'll get
      even her hat,&rdquo; he said, and once more he plunged in. The hat was farther
      out than the girl had been, and he had more trouble in securing it.
      Daireen saw that his head was covered more than once, and she was in great
      distress. At last, however, he struggled to the beach with the hat in his
      hand. It was very terrible to the girl to see him turn, squeezing the
      water from his hair, and curse the sea and all that pertained to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, however, he looked round and walked up to where she was now
      standing. He handed her the hat as though he had just picked it up from
      the sand. Then he looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe I'm the politest man in this infernal colony;
      if I was rude to you just now I ask your pardon. I'm afraid I pulled you
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saved me from drowning,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;If you had not come to me I
      should be dead now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't do it for your sake,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I did it because that's my
      enemy&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to the sea&mdash;&ldquo;and I wouldn't lose a chance of
      having a shy at him. It's my impression he's only second best this time
      again. Never mind. How do you feel, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little tired,&rdquo; said Daireen. &ldquo;I don't think I could walk back to
      the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't need,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Here comes a Cape cart and two ancient
      swells in it. If they don't give you a seat, I'll smash the whole
      contrivance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Daireen joyfully; &ldquo;it is papa&mdash;papa himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the party with the brass buttons?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;All right, I'll
      hail them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gerald sprang from the Cape cart in which he was driving with the
      commodore of the naval station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Daireen, what does this mean?&rdquo; he cried, looking from the girl
      to the man beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Daireen, regardless of her dripping condition, threw herself into his
      arms, and the stranger turned away whistling. He reached the road and
      shook his head confidentially at the commodore, who was standing beside
      the Cape cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touching thing to be a father, eh, Admiral?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, sir,&rdquo; said the commodore. &ldquo;You must wait till this is explained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Who is there here that will keep me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say to you, sir?&rdquo; cried Colonel Gerald, coming up and holding
      out his hand to the stranger. &ldquo;I have no words to thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as to that, General,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;it seems to me the less that's
      said the better. Take my advice and get the lady something to drink&mdash;anything
      that teetotallers won't allow is safe to be wholesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my house,&rdquo; said the commodore. &ldquo;Miss Gerald will find everything
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet you'll find something in the spirituous way at the admiral's
      quarters, miss,&rdquo; remarked the stranger, as Daireen was helped into the
      vehicle. &ldquo;No, thank you, General, I'll walk to the hotel where I put up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray let me call upon you before I leave,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to see you, General; if you come within the next two hours,
      I'll slip the tinsel off a bottle of Moët with you. Now, don't wait here.
      If you had got a pearly stream of salt water running down your spine you
      wouldn't wait; would they, miss? Aw revaw.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Q</span>UITE three hours
      had passed before Colonel Gerald was able to return to the hotel. The
      stranger was sitting in the coffee-room with a tumbler and a square bottle
      of cognac in front of him as the colonel entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, General,&rdquo; cried the stranger, &ldquo;you are come. I was sorry I said two
      hours, you know, because, firstly, I might have known that at the
      admiral's quarters the young lady would get as many doses as would make
      her fancy something was the matter with her; and, secondly, because I
      didn't think that they would take three hours to dry a suit of tweed like
      this. You see it, General; this blooming suit is a proof of the low state
      of morality that exists in this colony. The man I bought it from took an
      oath that it wouldn't shrink, and yet, just look at it. It's a wicked
      world this we live in, General. I went to bed while the suit was being
      dried, and I believe they kept the fire low so that they may charge me
      with the bed. And how is the young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy to say that she has quite recovered from the effects of her
      exhaustion and her wetting,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald. &ldquo;Had you not been near,
      and had you not had that brave heart you showed, my daughter would have
      been lost. But I need not say anything to you&mdash;you know how I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may take it for granted,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that either of us could say would make it plainer, at any rate.
      You don't live in this city, General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I live near Cape Town, where I am now returning with my daughter,&rdquo;
       said Colonel Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's queer,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Here am I too not living here and just
      waiting to get the post-cart to bring me to Cape Town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need scarcely say that I should be delighted if you would accept a seat
      with me,&rdquo; remarked the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say that if there's not a seat to spare, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir, we have two seats to spare. Can I tell my man to put
      your portmanteau in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if he can find it,&rdquo; laughed the stranger. &ldquo;Fact is, General, I
      haven't any property here except this tweed suit two sizes too small for
      me now. But these trousers have got pockets, and the pockets hold a good
      many sovereigns without bursting. I mean to set up a portmanteau in Cape
      Town. Yes, I'll take a seat with you so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was scarcely the sort of man Colonel Gerald would have chosen
      to accompany him under ordinary circumstances, but now he felt towards the
      rough man who had saved the life of his daughter as he would towards a
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wagonette drove round to the commodore's house for Daireen, and the
      stranger expressed very frankly the happiness he felt at finding her
      nothing the worse for her accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed she did not seem to have suffered greatly; she was a little
      paler, and the commodore's people insisted on wrapping her up elaborately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so very foolish of me,&rdquo; she said to the stranger, when they had
      passed out of Simon's Town and were going rapidly along the road to
      Wynberg. &ldquo;It was so very foolish indeed to sit down upon that rock and
      forget all about the tide. I must have been there an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, miss,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I'll take my oath it wasn't of your pa you were
      thinking all that time. Ah, these young fellows have a lot to answer for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not very subtle humour, Colonel Gerald felt; he found himself
      wishing that his daughter had owed her life to a more refined man; but on
      the whole he was just as glad that a man of sensitiveness had not been in
      the place of this coarse stranger upon that beach a few hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I am wrong in believing that you have travelled a good
      deal,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald, in some anxiety lest the stranger might pursue
      his course of humorous banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Travelled?&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Perhaps I have. Yes, sir, I have
      travelled, not excursionised. I've knocked about God's footstool since I
      was a boy, and yet it seems to me that I'm only beginning my travels. I've
      been&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the stranger continued telling of where he had been until the oak
      avenue at Mowbray was reached. He talked very freshly and frankly of every
      place both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The account of his
      travels was very interesting, though perhaps to the colonel's servant it
      was the most entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken it for granted that you have no engagement in Cape Town,&rdquo;
       said Colonel Gerald as he turned the horses down the avenue. &ldquo;We shall be
      dining in a short time, and I hope you will join us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to intrude, General,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;But I allow that I
      could dine heartily without going much farther. As for having an
      appointment in Cape Town&mdash;I don't know a single soul in the colony&mdash;not
      a soul, sir&mdash;unless&mdash;why, hang it all, who's that standing on
      the walk in front of us?&mdash;I'm a liar, General; I do know one man in
      the colony; there he stands, for if that isn't Oswin Markham I'll eat him
      with relish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed Markham,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald. &ldquo;And you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know him?&rdquo; the stranger laughed. &ldquo;Know him?&rdquo; Then as the wagonette pulled
      up beside where Markham was standing in front of the house, the stranger
      leapt down, saying, as he clapped Oswin on the shoulder, &ldquo;The General asks
      me if I know you, old boy; answer for me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Oswin Markham was staring blankly from the man to Daireen and her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me you were going to New York,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I was when you packed me aboard the <i>Virginia</i> brig so neatly
      at Natal, but the <i>Virginia</i> brig put into Simon's Bay and cut her
      cable one night, leaving me ashore. It's Providence, Oswin&mdash;Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswin had allowed his hand to be taken by the man, who was the same that
      had spent the night with him in the hotel at Pietermaritzburg. Then he
      turned as if from a fit of abstraction, to Daireen and the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon a thousand times,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But this meeting with Mr.
      Despard has quite startled me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Despard,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;I must ever look on as one of my best
      friends, though we met to-day for the first time. I owe him a debt that I
      can never repay&mdash;my daughter's life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswin turned and grasped the hand of the man whom he had called Mr.
      Despard, before they entered the house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daireen went in just before Markham; they had not yet exchanged a
      sentence, but when her father and Despard had entered one of the rooms,
      she turned, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month&mdash;a month yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it must be more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed low as she went on to her room. But when she found
      herself apart from every one, she did not laugh. She had her own
      preservation from death to reflect upon, but it occupied her mind less
      than the thought that came to her shaping itself into the words, &ldquo;He has
      returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man of whom she was thinking was standing pale and silent in a room
      where much conversation was floating, for Mr. Harwood had driven out with
      Markham from Cape Town, and he had a good deal to say on the Zulu
      question, which was beginning to be no question. The Macnamara had also
      come to pass the evening with Colonel Gerald, and he was not silent. Oswin
      watched Despard and the hereditary monarch speaking together, and he saw
      them shake hands. Harwood was in close conversation with Colonel Gerald,
      but he was not so utterly absorbed in his subject but that he could notice
      how Markham's eyes were fixed upon the stranger. The terms of a new
      problem were suggesting themselves to Mr. Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Daireen entered the room, and greeted Mr. Harwood courteously&mdash;much
      too courteously for his heart's desire. He did not feel so happy as he
      should have done, when she laughed pleasantly and reminded him of her
      prophecy as to his safe return. He felt as he had done on that morning
      when he had said good-bye to her: his time had not yet come. But what was
      delaying that hour he yearned for? She was now standing beside Markham,
      looking up to his face as she spoke to him. She was not smiling at him.
      What could these things mean? Harwood asked himself&mdash;Lottie Vincent's
      spiteful remark with reference to Daireen at the lunch that had taken
      place on the hillside in his absence&mdash;Oswin's remark about not being
      strong enough to leave the associations of Cape Town&mdash;this quiet
      meeting without smiles or any of the conventionalities of ordinary
      acquaintance&mdash;what did all these mean? Mr. Harwood felt that he had
      at last got before him the terms of a question the working out of which
      was more interesting to him than any other that could be propounded. And
      he knew also that this man Despard was an important auxiliary to its
      satisfactory solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dove of Glenmara, let me look upon your sweet face again, and say that
      you are not hurt,&rdquo; cried The Macnamara, taking the girl by both her hands
      and looking into her face. &ldquo;Thank God you are left to be the pride of the
      old country. We are not here to weep over this new sorrow. What would life
      be worth to us if anything had happened to the pulse of our hearts?
      Glenmara would be desolate and Slieve Docas would sit in ashes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Macnamara pressed his lips to the girl's forehead as a condescending
      monarch embraces a favoured subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, King! you'd make a fortune with that sort of sentiment on the
      boards; you would, by heavens!&rdquo; said Mr. Despard with an unmodulated
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Macnamara seemed to take this testimony as a compliment, for he
      smiled, though the remark did not appear to strike any one else as being
      imbued with humour. Harwood looked at the man curiously; but Markham was
      gazing in another direction without any expression upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the evening the Bishop of the Calapash Islands dropped
      in. His lordship had taken a house in the neighbourhood for so long as he
      would be remaining in the colony; and since he had had that interview with
      Mrs. Crawford, his visits to his old friend Colonel Gerald were numerous
      and unconventional. He, too, smiled upon Dairecn in his very pleasantest
      manner, and after hearing from the colonel&mdash;who felt perhaps that
      some little explanation of the stranger's presence might be necessary&mdash;of
      Daireen's accident, the bishop spoke a few words to Mr. Despard and shook
      hands with him&mdash;an honour which Mr. Despard sustained without
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of these civilities, however, this evening was unlike any that
      the colonel's friends had spent at the cottage. The bishop only remained
      for about an hour, and Harwood and Markham soon afterwards took their
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take a seat with you, Oswin, my boy,&rdquo; said Despard. &ldquo;We'll be at the
      same hotel in Cape Town, and we may as well all go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they did all go together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine fellow, the colonel, isn't he?&rdquo; remarked Despard, before they had
      got well out of the avenue. &ldquo;I called him general on chance when I saw him
      for the first time to-day&mdash;you're never astray in beginning at
      general and working your way down, with these military nobs. And the
      bishop is a fine old boy too&mdash;rather too much palm-oil and glycerine
      about him, though&mdash;too smooth and shiny for my taste. I expect he
      does a handsome trade amongst the Salamanders. A smart bishop could make a
      fortune there, I know. And then the king&mdash;the Irish king as he calls
      himself&mdash;well, maybe he's the best of the lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There did not seem to be anything in Mr. Despard's opening speech that
      required an answer. There was a considerable pause before Harwood remarked
      quietly: &ldquo;By the way, Mr. Despard, I think I saw you some time ago. I have
      a good recollection for faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; said Despard. &ldquo;Where was it? At 'Frisco or Fiji? South Carolina
      or South Australia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not recalling the possibilities of such faraway memories,&rdquo; said
      Harwood. &ldquo;But if I don't mistake, you were the person in the audience at
      Pietermaritzburg who made some remark complimentary to Markham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed. &ldquo;You are right, mister. I only wonder I didn't shout out
      something before, for I never was so taken aback as when I saw him come
      out as that Prince. A shabby trick it was you played on me the next
      morning, Oswin&mdash;I say it was infernally shabby. You know what he did,
      mister: when I had got to the outside of more than one bottle of Moët, and
      so wasn't very clear-headed, he packed me into one of the carts, drove me
      to Durban before daylight, and sent me aboard the <i>Virginia</i> brig
      that I had meant to leave. That wasn't like friendship, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But upon this delicate question Mr. Harwood did not think it prudent to
      deliver an opinion. Markham himself was mute, yet this did not seem to
      have a depressing effect upon Mr. Despard. He gave a <i>résumé</i> of the
      most important events in the voyage of the <i>Virginia</i> brig, and
      described very graphically how he had unfortunately become insensible to
      the fact that the vessel was leaving Simon's Bay on the previous morning;
      so that when he awoke, the <i>Virginia</i> brig was on her way to New York
      city, while he was on a sofa in the hotel surrounded by empty bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Markham was alone with this man in a room at the hotel at Cape Town,
      Despard became even more talkative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens, Oswin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have changed your company a bit since
      you were amongst us; generals, bishops, and kings&mdash;kings, by Jingo&mdash;seem
      to be your chums here. Well, don't you think that I don't believe you to
      be right. You were never of our sort in Australia&mdash;we all felt you to
      be above us, and treated you so&mdash;making a pigeon of you now and
      again, but never looking on ourselves as your equal. By heavens, I think
      now that I have got in with these people and seem to get on so well with
      them, I'll turn over a new leaf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to stay here longer than this week?&rdquo; asked Oswin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This week? I'll not leave for another month&mdash;another six months,
      maybe. I've money, my boy, and&mdash;suppose we have something to drink&mdash;something
      that will sparkle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to drink anything,&rdquo; Oswin replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have something,&rdquo; Despard insisted. &ldquo;You must admit that though
      the colonel is a glorious old boy, he didn't do the hospitable in the
      liquid way. But I'll keep in with the lot of them. I'll go out to see the
      colonel and his pretty daughter now and again. Ah, by George, that pretty
      daughter seems to have played the mischief with some of the young fellows
      about here. 'Sir,' says the king of Ireland to me, 'I fale more than I can
      till ye: the swate girl ye saved is to be me sonn's broide.' This looked
      well enough for the king, and we got very great friends, as you saw. But
      then the bishop comes up to me and, says he, 'Sir, allow me to shake you
      by the hand. You do not know how I feel towards that young lady who owes
      her life to your bravery.' I looked at him seriously: 'Bishop,' said I, 'I
      can't encourage this sort of thing. You might be her father.' Well, my
      boy, you never saw anything so flustered as that bishop became; it was
      more than a minute before he could tell me that it was his son who had the
      tender heart about the girl. That bishop didn't ask me to dine with him;
      though the king did, and I'm going out to him to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to him?&rdquo; said Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I am. He agreed with me about the colonel's hospitality in the
      drink way. 'You'll find it different in my house,' said the king; and I
      think you know, Oswin, that the king and me have one point in common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Markham, going to the door. &ldquo;No, I told you I did not
      mean to drink anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left Mr. Despard on the sofa smoking the first of a box of cigars he
      had just ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's changed&mdash;that boy is,&rdquo; said Despard. &ldquo;He wouldn't have gone out
      in that fashion six months ago. But what the deuce has changed him? that's
      what I'd like to know. He wants to get me away from here&mdash;that's
      plain&mdash;plain? by George, it's ugly. But here I am settled for a few
      months at least if&mdash;hang that waiter, is he never going to bring me
      that bottle of old Irish?&rdquo;

    <p>
      Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play
      upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of
      my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my
      compass....'S blood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>SWIN Markham sat
      in his own room in the hotel. The window was open, and through it from the
      street below came the usual sounds of Cape Town&mdash;terrible Dutch
      mingling with Malay and dashed with Kafir. It was not the intensity of a
      desire to listen to this polyglot mixture that caused Markham to go upon
      the balcony and stand looking out to the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected upon what had passed since he had been in this place a month
      before. He had gone up to Natal, and in company of Harwood he had had a
      brief hunting expedition. He had followed the spoor of the gemsbok over
      veldt and through kloof, sleeping in the house of the hospitable boers
      when chance offered; but all the time he had been possessed of one supreme
      thought&mdash;one supreme hope that made his life seem a joyous thing&mdash;he
      had looked forward to this day&mdash;the day when he would have returned,
      when he would again be able to look into the face that moved like a
      phantom before him wherever he went. And he had returned&mdash;for this&mdash;this
      looking, not into her face, but into the street below him, while he
      thought if it would not be better for him to step out beyond the balcony&mdash;out
      into the blank that would follow his casting of himself down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to the conclusion that it would not be better to step beyond the
      balcony. A thought seemed to strike him as he stood out there. He returned
      to his chamber and threw himself on his bed, but he did not remain passive
      for long; once more he stepped into the air, and now he had need to wipe
      his forehead with his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an hour afterwards that he undressed himself; but the bugle at the
      barracks had sounded a good many times before he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood, too, had an hour of reflection when he went to his room; but
      his thoughts were hardly of the excitable type of Markham's; they had,
      however, a definite result, which caused him to seek out Mr. Despard in
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Despard had just finished a light and salutary breakfast consisting of
      a glass of French brandy in a bottle of soda-water, and he was smoking
      another sample of that box of cigars on the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning to you, mister,&rdquo; he said, nodding as Harwood came, as if by
      chance, beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how do you do?&rdquo; said Harwood. &ldquo;Enjoying your morning smoke, I see.
      Well, I hope you are nothing the worse for your plunge yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, nothing; I only hope that Missy out there will be as sound. I
      don't think they insisted on her drinking enough afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, perhaps not. Your friend Markham has not come down yet, they tell
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was never given to running ties with the sun,&rdquo; said Mr. Despard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me you were a particular friend of his in Australia?&rdquo; continued
      Mr. Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, men very soon get to be friends out there; but Oswin and myself were
      closer than brothers in every row and every lark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of which you had, no doubt, a good many?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good few, yes; a few that wouldn't do to be printed specially as prizes
      for young ladies' boarding-schools&mdash;not but what the young ladies
      would read them if they got the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few fellows would care to write their autobiographies and go into the
      details of their life,&rdquo; said Harwood. &ldquo;I suppose you got into trouble now
      and again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble? Well, yes, when the money ran short, and there was no balance at
      the bank; that's real trouble, let me tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is; but I mean, did you not sometimes need the friendly
      offices of a lawyer after a wild few days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Despard, throwing away the end of his cigar, &ldquo;if your idea of
      a wild few days is housebreaking or manslaughter, it wasn't ours, I can
      tell you. No, my boy, we never took to bushranging; and though I've had my
      turn with Derringer's small cannons when I was at Chokeneck Gulch, it was
      only because it was the custom of the country. No, sir; Oswin, though he
      seems to have turned against me here, will still have my good word, for I
      swear to you he never did anything that made the place too hot for him,
      though I don't suppose that if he was in a competitive examination for a
      bishopric the true account of his life in Melbourne would help him
      greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are none of us here who mean to be bishops,&rdquo; laughed Harwood. &ldquo;But
      I understood from a few words Markham let fall that&mdash;well, never
      mind, he is a right good fellow, as I found when we went up country
      together a couple of weeks ago. By the way, do you mean to remain here
      long, Mr. Despard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is short, mister, and I've learned never to make arrangements very
      far in advance. I've about eighty sovereigns with me, and I'll stay here
      till they're spent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your stay will be proportionate to your spending powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an inverse ratio, as they used to say at school,&rdquo; said Despard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Harwood went into the room he reflected that on the whole he had
      not gained much information from Mr. Despard; and Mr. Despard reflected
      that on the whole Mr. Harwood had not got much information by his system
      of leading questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half an hour afterwards Markham came out upon the balcony, and gave
      a little unaccountable start on seeing its sole occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, my boy! have you turned up at last?&rdquo; cried Despard. &ldquo;Our good old
      Calapash friend will tell you that unless you get up with the lark you'll
      never do anything in the world. You should have been here a short time ago
      to witness the hydraulic experiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what?&rdquo; said Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hydraulic experiments. The patent pump of the <i>Dominant Trumpeter</i>
      was being tested upon me. Experiments failed, not through any incapacity
      of the pump, but through the contents of the reservoir worked upon not
      running free enough in the right direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Mr. Harwood here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was, my boy. And he wanted to know all about how we lived in
      Melbourne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you told him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get up a little earlier in the morning when he wants to try his
      pumping apparatus. But what made you give that start? Don't you know that
      all I could tell would be some of our old larks, and he wouldn't have
      thought anything the worse of you on account of them? Hang it all, you
      don't mean to say you're going into holy orders, that you mind having any
      of the old times brought back? If you do, I'm afraid that it will be
      awkward for you if I talk in my ordinary way. I won't bind myself not to
      tell as many of our larks as chime in with the general conversation. I
      only object on principle to be pumped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk away,&rdquo; said Oswin spasmodically. &ldquo;Tell of all our larks. How could I
      be affected by anything you may tell of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! That's what I say. Larks are larks. There was no manslaughter nor
      murder. No, there was no murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there was no murder,&rdquo; said Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other burst into a laugh that startled a Malay in the street below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens, from the way you said that one would fancy there had been a
      murder,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a long pause, which was broken by Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still intend to go out to dine with that man you met yesterday?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't call him a man, Oswin; you wouldn't call a bishop a man, and why
      call a king one. Yes, I have ordered a horse that is said to know the way
      across those Flats without a pocket compass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you say the house was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's near a place called Rondebosch. I remember the locality well, though
      it's ten years since I was there. The shortest way back is through a
      pine-wood at the far end of The Flats&mdash;you know that place, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know The Flats. And you mean to come through the pine-wood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do mean it. It's a nasty place to ride through, but the horse always
      goes right in a case like that, and I'll give him his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care that you have your own at that time,&rdquo; said Markham. &ldquo;The house
      of the Irishman is not like Colonel Gerald's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, for a more thirsty evening I never spent than at your
      friend's cottage. The good society hardly made up for the want of drink.
      It put me in mind of the story of the man that found the pearls when he
      was starving in the desert. What are bishops and kings to a fellow if he
      is thirsty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will leave the house to return here between eleven and twelve, I
      suppose?&rdquo; said Oswin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should say that about eleven will see me on my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will go through the pine-wood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, my boy, and across The Flats until I pass the little river&mdash;it's
      there still, I suppose. And now suppose I buy you a drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Oswin Markham declined to be the object of such a purchase. He went
      back to his own room, and threw himself on his bed, where he remained for
      more than an hour. Then he rose and wiped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled down some books that he had bought, and tried to read bits of
      one or two. He sat diligently down as if he meant to go through a day's
      reading, but he did not appear to be in the mood for applying himself to
      anything. He threw the books aside and turned over some newspapers; but
      these did not seem to engross him any more than the books had done. He lay
      back in his chair, and after a while his restlessness subsided: he had
      fallen asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the afternoon before he awoke with a sudden start. He heard the
      sound of voices in the street below his window. He went forward, and,
      looking out, was just in time to see Harry Despard mounting his horse at
      the hotel door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be back about midnight,&rdquo; he said to the porter of the hotel, and
      then he trotted off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markham heard the sound of the horse's hoofs die away on the street, and
      he repeated the man's words: &ldquo;About midnight.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>SWIN Markham dined
      at the hotel late in the evening, and when he was in the act Harwood came
      into the room dressed for a dinner-party at Greenpoint to which he had
      been invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend Mr. Despard is not here?&rdquo; said Harwood, looking around the
      room. &ldquo;I wanted to see him for a moment to give him a few words of advice
      that may be useful to him. I wish to goodness you would speak to him,
      Markham; he has been swaggering about in a senseless way, talking of
      having his pockets full of sovereigns, and in the hearing of every
      stranger that comes into the hotel. In the bar a few hours ago he repeated
      his boast to the Malay who brought him his horse. Now, for Heaven's sake,
      tell him that unless he wishes particularly to have a bullet in his head
      or a khris in his body some of these nights, he had better hold his tongue
      about his wealth&mdash;that is what I meant to say to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are right,&rdquo; cried Oswin, starting up suddenly. &ldquo;He has been
      talking in the hearing of men who would do anything for the sake of a few
      sovereigns. What more likely than that some of them should follow him and
      knock him down? That will be his end, Harwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It need not be,&rdquo; replied Harwood. &ldquo;If you caution him, he will most
      likely regard what you say to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will caution him&mdash;if I see him again,&rdquo; said Markham; then Harwood
      left the room, and Markham sat down again, but he did not continue his
      dinner. He sat there staring at his plate. &ldquo;What more likely?&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;What more likely than that he should be followed and murdered
      by some of these men? If his body should be found with his pockets empty,
      no one could doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat there for a considerable time&mdash;until the streets had become
      dark; then he rose and went up to his own room for a while, and finally he
      put on his hat and left the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch as he walked to the railway station, and saw that
      he would be just in time to catch a train leaving for Wynberg. He took a
      ticket for the station on the Cape Town side of Mowbray, where he got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked from the station to the road and again looked at his watch: it
      was not yet nine o'clock; and then he strolled aside upon a little
      foot-track that led up the lower slopes of the Peak above Mowbray. The
      night was silent and moonless. Upon the road only at intervals came the
      rumbling of bullock wagons and the shouts of the Kafir drivers. The hill
      above him was sombre and untouched by any glance of light, and no breeze
      stirred up the scents of the heath. He walked on in the silence until he
      had come to the ravine of silver firs. He passed along the track at the
      edge and was soon at the spot where he had sat at the feet of Daireen a
      month before. He threw himself down on the short coarse grass just as he
      had done then, and every moment of the hour they had passed together came
      back to him. Every word that had been spoken, every thought that had
      expressed itself upon that lovely face which the delicate sunset light had
      touched&mdash;all returned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had he said to her? That the past life he had lived was blotted out
      from his mind? Yes, he had tried to make himself believe that; but now how
      Fate had mocked him! He had been bitterly forced to acknowledge that the
      past was a part of the present. His week so full of bitterest suffering
      had not formed a dividing line between the two lives he fancied might be
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the justice of God?&rdquo; he cried out now to the stars, clasping his
      hands in agony above his head. &ldquo;It is unjust. My life would have been pure
      and good now, if I had been granted my right of forgetfulness. But I have
      been made the plaything of God.&rdquo; He stood with his hands clasped on his
      head for long. Then he gave a laugh. &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;man is master of his
      fate. I shall do myself the justice that God has denied me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came down from that solemn mount, and crossed he road at a nearer point
      than the Mowbray avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon found himself by the brink of that little river which flowed past
      Rondebosch and Mowbray. He got beneath the trees that bordered its banks,
      and stood for a long time in the dead silence of the night. The mighty
      dog-lilies were like pictures beneath him; and only now and again came
      some of those mysterious sounds of night&mdash;the rustling of certain
      leaves when all the remainder were motionless, the winnowing of the wings
      of some night creature whose form remained invisible, the sudden stirring
      of ripples upon the river without a cause being apparent&mdash;the man
      standing there heard all, and all appeared mysterious to him. He wondered
      how he could have so often been by night in places like this, without
      noticing how mysterious the silence was&mdash;how mysterious the strange
      sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked along by the bank of the slow river, until he was just opposite
      Mowbray. A little bridge with rustic rails was, he knew, at hand, by which
      he would cross the stream&mdash;for he must cross it. But before he had
      reached it, he heard a sound. He paused. Could it be possible that it was
      the sound of a horse's hoofs? There he waited until something white passed
      from under the trees and reached the bridge, standing between him and the
      other side of the river&mdash;something that barred his way. He leant
      against the tree nearest to him, for he seemed to be falling to the
      ground, and then through the stillness of the night the voice of Daireen
      came singing a snatch of song&mdash;his song. She was on the little bridge
      and leaning upon the rail. In a few moments she stood upright, and
      listlessly walked under the trees where he was standing, though she could
      not see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen,&rdquo; he said gently, so that she might not be startled; and she was
      not startled, she only walked backwards a few steps until she was again at
      the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any one speak?&rdquo; she said almost in a whisper. And then he stood
      before her while she laughed with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you stand there?&rdquo; he said in a tone of wonder. &ldquo;What was it sent
      you to stand there between me and the other side of that river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said to papa that I would wait for him here. He went to see Major
      Crawford part of the way to the house where the Crawfords are staying; but
      what can be keeping him from returning I don't know. I promised not to go
      farther than the avenue, and I have just been here a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her standing there before him. &ldquo;Oh God! oh God!&rdquo; he said, as
      he reflected upon what his own thoughts had been a moment before.
      &ldquo;Daireen, you are an angel of God&mdash;that angel which stood between the
      living and the dead. Stay near me. Oh, child! what do I not owe to you? my
      life&mdash;the peace of my soul for ever and ever. And yet&mdash;must we
      speak no word of love together, Daireen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one&mdash;here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not one&mdash;only&mdash;ah, my love, my
      love, why should we speak of it? It is all my life&mdash;I breathe it&mdash;I
      think it&mdash;it is myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her and laughed. &ldquo;This moment is ours,&rdquo; he said with
      tremulous passion. &ldquo;God cannot pluck it from us. It is an immortal moment,
      if our souls are immortal. Child, can God take you away from me before I
      have kissed you on the mouth?&rdquo; He held her face between his hands and
      kissed her. &ldquo;Darling, I have taken your white soul into mine,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they stood apart on that bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must never frighten me with your strange words
      again. I do not know what you mean sometimes, but then that is because I
      don't know very much. I feel that you are good and true, and I have
      trusted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be true to you,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I will die loving you better
      than any hope man has of heaven. Daireen, never dream, whatever may
      happen, that I shall not love you while my soul lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will believe you,&rdquo; she said; and then voices were heard coming down the
      lane of aloes at the other side of the river&mdash;voices and the sound of
      a horse's hoofs. Colonel Gerald and Major Crawford were coming along
      leading a horse, across whose saddle lay a black mass. Oswin Markham gave
      a start. Then Daireen's father hastened forward to where she was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;go back&mdash;go back to the house. I will come
      to you in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, papa?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;No one is hurt?&mdash;Major
      Crawford is not hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, he is here; but go, Daireen&mdash;go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and went up the avenue without a word. But she saw that Oswin
      was not looking at her&mdash;that he was grasping the rail of the bridge
      while he gazed to where the horse with its burden stood a few yards away
      among the aloes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you chance to be here, Markham,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald hurriedly.
      &ldquo;Something has happened&mdash;that man Despard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dead&mdash;not murdered!&rdquo; gasped Oswin, clutching the rail with both
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murdered? no; how could he be murdered? he must have fallen from his
      horse among the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is dead&mdash;he is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself, Markham,&rdquo; said the colonel; &ldquo;he is not dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in that sense, my boy,&rdquo; laughed Major Crawford. &ldquo;By gad, if we could
      leave the brute up to the neck in the river here for a few hours I fancy
      he would be treated properly. Hold him steady, Markham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswin put his hand mechanically to the feet of the man who was lying
      helplessly across the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dead, not dead,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only dead drunk, unless his skull is fractured, my boy,&rdquo; laughed the
      major. &ldquo;We'll take him to the stables, of course, George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, to the house,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run on and get the key of the stables, George,&rdquo; said the major
      authoritatively. &ldquo;Don't you suppose in any way that your house is to be
      turned into an hospital for dipsomaniacs. Think of the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gerald made a little pause, and then hastened forward to awaken
      the groom to get the key of the stables, which were some distance from the
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad, Markham, I'd like to spill the brute into that pond,&rdquo; whispered
      the major to Oswin, as they waited for the colonel's return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find him? Did you see any accident?&rdquo; asked Oswin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We met the horse trotting quietly along the avenue without a rider, and
      when we went on among the trees we found the fellow lying helpless. George
      said he was killed, but I knew better. Irish whisky, my boy, was what
      brought him down, and you will find that I am right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They let the man slide from the saddle upon a heap of straw when the
      stable door was opened by the half-dressed groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dead, Jack?&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald as a lantern was held to the man's
      face. Only the major was looking at the man; Markham could not trust
      himself even to glance towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;Why, since we have laid him down I have heard him
      frame three distinct oaths. Have you a bucket of water handy, my good man?
      No, it needn't be particularly clean. Ah, that will do. Now, if you don't
      hear a choice selection of colonial blasphemy, he's dead and, by gad, sir,
      so am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major's extensive experience of the treatment of colonial complaints
      had, as the result proved, led him to form a correct if somewhat hasty
      diagnosis of the present case. Not more than a gallon of the water had
      been thrown upon the man before he recovered sufficient consciousness to
      allow of his expressing himself with freedom on the subject of his
      treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; chuckled the major. &ldquo;Fill the bucket again, my man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gerald could only laugh now that his fears had been dispelled. He
      hastened to the house to tell Daireen that there was no cause for alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the second bucketful had been applied, in pursuance of the
      major's artless system of resuscitation, Despard was sitting up talking of
      the oppressions under which a certain nation was groaning. He was
      sympathetic and humorous in turn; weeping after particular broken
      sentences, and chuckling with laughter after other parts of his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Irish eloquence and the Irish whisky have run neck and neck for the
      fellow's soul,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;If we hadn't picked him up he would be in
      a different state now. Are you going back to Cape Town to-night, Markham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Oswin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's lucky. You mustn't let George have his way in this matter. This
      brute would stay in the cottage up there for a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must not do that,&rdquo; cried Markham eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy; so you will drive with him in the Cape cart to the hotel. He
      will give you no trouble if you lay him across the floor and keep your
      feet well down upon his chest. Put one of the horses in, my man,&rdquo;
       continued the major, turning to the groom. &ldquo;You will drive in with Mr.
      Markham, and bring the cart back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Colonel Gerald had returned from the house a horse was harnessed to
      the Cape cart, Despard had been lifted up and placed in an easy attitude
      against one of the seats. And only a feeble protest was offered by the
      colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Markham,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was very lucky you were passing where my
      daughter saw you. You know this man Despard&mdash;how could I have him in
      my house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your house!&rdquo; cried Markham. &ldquo;Thank God I was here to prevent that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cape cart was already upon the avenue and the lamps were lighted. But
      a little qualm seemed to come to the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure he is not injured&mdash;that he has quite recovered from any
      possible effects?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the husky voice of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go'night, king, go'night. I'm alright&mdash;horse know's way. We're
      tram'led on, king&mdash;'pressed people&mdash;but wormil turn&mdash;wormil
      turn&mdash;never mind&mdash;Go save Ireland&mdash;green flag litters o'er
      us&mdash;tread th' land that bore us&mdash;go'night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cart was in motion before the man's words had ceased.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>SWIN Markham lay
      awake nearly all that night after he had reached the hotel. His thoughts
      were not of that even nature whose proper sequence is sleep. He thought of
      all that had passed since he had left the room he was lying in now. What
      had been on his mind on leaving this room&mdash;what had his determination

      The morning came with the sound of marching soldiers in the street below;
      with the cry of bullock-wagon-drivers and the rattle of the rude carts;
      with the morning and the sounds of life&mdash;the breaking of the deadly
      silence of the night&mdash;sleep came to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost midday before he awoke, and for some time after opening his
      eyes he was powerless to recollect anything that had happened during the
      night; his awakening now was as his return to consciousness on board the
      <i>Cardwell Castle</i>,&mdash;a great blank seemed to have taken place in
      his life&mdash;the time of unconsciousness was a gulf that all his efforts
      of memory could not at first bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked around the room, and his first consciousness was the
      recollection of what his thoughts of the previous evening had been when he
      had slept in the chair before the window and had awakened to see Despard
      ride away. He failed at once to remember anything of the interval of
      night; only with that one recollection burning on his brain he looked at
      his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time he remembered everything. He knew that Despard was in the
      hotel. He dressed himself and went downstairs, and found Harwood in the
      coffee-room, reading sundry documents with as anxious an expression of
      countenance as a special correspondent ever allows himself to assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the news?&rdquo; Markham asked, feeling certain that something unusual
      had either taken place or was seen by the prophetical vision of Harwood to
      be looming in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War,&rdquo; said Harwood, looking up. &ldquo;War, Markham. I should never have left
      Natal. They have been working up to the point for the last few months, as
      I saw; but now there is no hope for a peaceful settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Zulu chief is not likely to come to terms now?&rdquo; said Markham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Quite impossible. In a few days there
      will, no doubt, be a call for volunteers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For volunteers?&rdquo; Markham repeated. &ldquo;You will go up country at once, I
      suppose?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite as a volunteer, but as soon as I receive my letters by the mail
      that arrives in a few days, I shall be off to Durban, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be glad of it, no doubt. You told me you liked doing
      war-correspondence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Harwood; and after a little pause he added slowly: &ldquo;It's a
      tiring life this I have been leading for the past fifteen years, Markham.
      I seem to have cut myself off from the sympathies of life. I seem to have
      been only a looker-on in the great struggles&mdash;the great pleasures&mdash;of
      life. I am supposed to have no more sympathies than Babbage's calculator
      that records certain facts without emotion, and I fancied I had schooled
      myself into this cold apathy in looking at things; but I don't think I
      have succeeded in cutting myself off from all sympathies. No, I shall not
      be glad of this war. Never mind. By the way, are you going out to Dr.
      Glaston's to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got a card for his dinner, but I cannot tell what I may do. I am
      not feeling myself, just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly don't look yourself, Markham. You are haggard, and as pale
      as if you had not got any sleep for nights. You want the constitution of
      your friend Mr. Despard, who is breakfasting in the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, is it possible he is out of his room?&rdquo; cried Markham, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he was waiting here an hour ago when I came down, and in the
      meantime he had been buying a suit of garments, he said, that gallant
      check of his having come to grief through the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harwood spoke the words at the door and then he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswin was not for long left in solitary occupation, however, for in a few
      moments the door was flung open, and Despard entered with a half-empty
      tumbler in his hand. He came forward with a little chuckling laugh and
      stood in front of Oswin without speaking. He looked with his blood-shot
      eyes into Oswin's cold pale face, and then burst into a laugh so hearty
      that he was compelled to leave the tumbler upon the table, not having
      sufficient confidence in his ability to grasp it under the influence of
      his excitement. Then he tapped Markham on the shoulder, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old boy, have you got over that lark of last night? Like the old
      times, wasn't it? You did the fatherly by me, I believe, though hang me if
      I remember what happened after I had drunk the last glass of old Irish
      with our friend the king. How the deuce did I get in with the teetotal
      colonel who, the boots has been telling me, lent me his cart? That's what
      I should like to know. And where were you, my boy, all the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despard,&rdquo; said Markham, &ldquo;I have borne with your brutal insults long
      enough. I will not bear them any longer. When you have so disgraced both
      yourself and me as you did last night, it is time to bring matters to a
      climax. I cannot submit to have you thrust yourself upon my friends as you
      have done. You behaved like a brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despard seated himself and wiped his eyes. &ldquo;I did behave like a brute,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I always do, I know&mdash;and you know too, Oswin. Never mind. Tell
      me what you want&mdash;what am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must leave the colony,&rdquo; said Oswin quickly, almost eagerly. &ldquo;I will
      give you money, and a ticket to England to-day. You must leave this place
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I will&mdash;so I will,&rdquo; said the man from behind his
      handkerchief. &ldquo;Yes, yes, Oswin, I'll leave the colony&mdash;I will&mdash;when
      I become a teetotaller.&rdquo; He took down his handkerchief, and put it into
      his pocket with a hoarse laugh. &ldquo;Come, my boy,&rdquo; he said in his usual
      voice, &ldquo;come; we've had quite enough of that sort of bullying. Don't think
      you're talking to a boy, Master Oswin. Who looks on a man as anything the
      worse for getting drunk now and again? You don't; you can't afford to. How
      often have I not helped you as you helped me? Tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the past&mdash;the accursed past,&rdquo; said Oswin, &ldquo;I may have made myself
      a fool&mdash;yes, I did, but God knows that I have suffered for it. Now
      all is changed. I was willing to tolerate you near me since we met this
      time, hoping that you would think fit, when you were in a new place and
      amongst new people, to change your way of life. But last night showed me
      that I was mistaken. You can never be received at Colonel Gerald's again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;You should break the news gently to a fellow. You
      might have thrown me into a fit by coming down like that. Hark you here,
      Mr. Markham. I know jolly well that I will be received there and welcomed
      too. I'll be received everywhere as well as you, and hang me, if I don't
      go everywhere. These people are my friends as well as yours. I've done
      more for them than ever you did, and they know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool, fool!&rdquo; said Oswin bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see who's the fool, my boy. I know my advantage, don't you be
      afraid. The Irish king has a son, hasn't he? well, I was welcome with him
      last night. The Lord Bishop of Calapash has another blooming male
      offspring, and though he hasn't given me an invite to his dinner this
      evening, yet, hang me, if he wouldn't hug me if I went with the rest of
      you swells. Hang me, if I don't try it at any rate&mdash;it will be a lark
      at least. Dine with a bishop&mdash;by heaven, sir, it would be a joke&mdash;I'll
      go, oh, Lord, Lord!&rdquo; Oswin stood motionless looking at him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
       continued Despard, &ldquo;I'll have a jolly hour with his lordship the bishop.
      I'll fill up my glass as I did last night, and we'll drink the same toast
      together&mdash;we'll drink to the health of the Snowdrop of Glenmara, as
      the king called her when he was very drunk; we'll drink to the fair
      Daireen. Hallo, keep your hands off!&mdash;Curse you, you're choking me!
      There!&rdquo; Oswin, before the girl's name had more than passed the man's lips,
      had sprung forward and clutched him by the throat; only by a violent
      effort was he cast off, and now both men stood trembling with passion face
      to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce do you mean by this sort of treatment?&rdquo; cried Despard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despard,&rdquo; said Oswin slowly, &ldquo;you know me a little, I think. I tell you
      if you ever speak that name again in my presence you will repent it. You
      know me from past experience, and I have not utterly changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at him with an expression that amounted to wonderment upon
      his face. Then he threw himself back in his chair, and an uncontrollable
      fit of laughter seized him. He lay back and almost yelled with his insane
      laughter. When he had recovered himself and had wiped the tears from his
      eyes, he saw Oswin was gone. And this fact threw him into another
      convulsive fit. It was a long time before he was able to straighten his
      collar and go to the bar for a glass of French brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last half-hour had made Oswin Markham very pale. He had eaten no
      breakfast, and he was reminded of this by the servant to whom he had given
      directions to have his horse brought to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have not eaten anything. Get the horse brought round
      quickly, like a good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood erect in the doorway until he heard the sound of hoofs. Then he
      went down the steps and mounted, turning his horse's head towards Wynberg.
      He galloped along the red road at the base of the hill, and only once he
      looked up, saying, &ldquo;For the last time&mdash;the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached the avenue at Mowbray and dismounted, throwing the bridle over
      his arm as he walked slowly between the rows of giant aloes. In another
      moment he came in sight of the Dutch cottage. He paused under one of the
      Australian oaks, and looked towards the house. &ldquo;Oh, God, God, pity me!&rdquo; he
      cried in agony so intense that it could not relieve itself by any movement
      or the least motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw the bridle over a low branch and walked up to the house. His step
      was heard. She stood before him in the hall&mdash;white and flushed in
      turn as he went towards her. He was not flushed; he was still deadly
      white. He had startled her, he knew, for the hand she gave him was
      trembling like a dove's bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa is gone part of the way back to Simon's Town with the commodore who
      was with us this morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you will come in and wait, will
      you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I cannot trust myself to go in&mdash;even to look at
      you, Daireen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are ill&mdash;your face&mdash;your voice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not ill, Daireen. I have an hour of strength&mdash;such strength as
      is given to men when they look at Death in the face and are not moved at
      all. I kissed you last night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will now,&rdquo; she said, clasping his arm tenderly. &ldquo;Dearest, do not
      speak so terribly&mdash;do not look so terrible&mdash;so like&mdash;ah,
      that night when you looked up to me from the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen, why did I do that? Why did you pluck me from that death to give
      me this agony of life&mdash;to give yourself all the bitterness that can
      come to any soul? Daireen, I kissed you only once, and I can never kiss
      you again. I cannot be false to you any longer after having touched your
      pure spirit. I have been false to you&mdash;false, not by my will&mdash;but
      because to me God denied what He gave to others&mdash;others to whom His
      gift was an agony&mdash;that divine power to begin life anew. My past
      still clings to me, Daireen&mdash;it is not past&mdash;it is about and
      around me still&mdash;it is the gulf that separates us, Daireen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Separates us?&rdquo; she said blankly, looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Separates us,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;as heaven and hell are separated. We have
      been the toys&mdash;the playthings, of Fate. If you had not looked out of
      your cabin that night, we should both be happy now. And then how was it we
      came to love each other and to know it to be love? I struggled against it,
      but I was as a feather upon the wind. Ah, God has given us this agony of
      love, for I am here to look on you for the last time&mdash;to beseech of
      you to hate me, and to go away knowing that you love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not to go away&mdash;anything but that. Tell me all&mdash;I can
      forgive all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot bring my lips to frame my curse,&rdquo; he said after a little pause.
      &ldquo;But you shall hear it, and, Daireen, pity me as you pitied me when I
      looked to God for hope and found none. Child&mdash;give me your eyes for
      the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held him clasped with her white hands, and he saw that her passion
      made her incapable of understanding his words. She looked up to him
      whispering, &ldquo;The last time&mdash;no, no&mdash;not the last time&mdash;not
      the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was in his arms. He looked down upon her face, but he did not kiss it.
      He clenched his teeth as he unwound her arms from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word may undo the curse that I have bound about your life,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Take the word, Daireen&mdash;the blessed word for you and me&mdash;<i>Forget</i>.
      Take it&mdash;it is my last blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing before him. She saw his face there, and she gave a cry,
      covering her own face with her hands, for the face she saw was that which
      had looked up to her from the black waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      From the river bank came the sounds of the native women, from the garden
      the hum of insects, and from the road the echo of a horse's hoofs passing
      gradually away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it a dream&mdash;not only this scene of broad motionless leaves, and
      these sounds she heard, but all the past months of her life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours went by leaving her motionless in that seat, and then came the sound
      of a horse&mdash;she sprang up. He was returning&mdash;it was a dream that
      had given her this agony of parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen, child, what is the matter?&rdquo; asked her father, whose horse it was
      she had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she said very gently, &ldquo;it is over&mdash;all&mdash;all over&mdash;for
      ever&mdash;I have only you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear little Dolly, tell me all that troubles you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing troubles me now, papa. I have you near me, and I do not mind
      anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all, Daireen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I loved some one else, papa&mdash;Oswin&mdash;Oswin Markham.
      But he is gone now, and I know you are with me. You will always be with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor little Dolly,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald, &ldquo;did he tell you that he
      loved you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did, papa; but you must ask me no more. I shall never see him again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly charming!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, standing at the door. &ldquo;The
      prettiest picture I have seen for a long time&mdash;father and daughter in
      each other's arms. But, my dear George, are you not yet dressed for the
      bishop's dinner? Daireen, my child, did you not say you would be ready
      when I would call for you? I am quite disappointed, and I would be angry
      only you look perfectly lovely this evening&mdash;like a beautiful lily.
      The dear bishop will be so charmed, for you are one of his favourites. Now
      do make haste, and I entreat of you to be particular with your shades of
      gray.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Bishop of the
      Calapash Islands and Metropolitan of the Salamander Archipelago was
      smiling very tranquilly upon his guests as they arrived at his house,
      which was about two miles from Mowbray. But the son of the bishop was not
      smiling&mdash;he, in fact, seldom smiled; there was a certain breadth of
      expression associated with such a manifestation of feeling that was
      inconsistent with his ideas of subtlety of suggestion. He was now
      endeavouring to place his father's guests at ease by looking only slightly
      bored by their presence, giving them to understand that he would endure
      them around him for his father's sake, so that there should be no need for
      them to be at all anxious on his account. A dinnerparty in a colony was
      hardly that sort of social demonstration which Mr. Glaston would be
      inclined to look forward to with any intensity of feeling; but the bishop,
      having a number of friends at the Cape, including a lady who was capable
      of imparting some very excellent advice on many social matters, had felt
      it to be a necessity to give this little dinnerparty, and his son had only
      offered such a protest against it as satisfied his own conscience and
      prevented the possibility of his being consumed for days after with a
      gnawing remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop had his own ideas of entertaining his guests&mdash;a matter
      which his son brought under his consideration after the invitations had
      been issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not such a thing as a rising tenor in the colony, I am sure,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Glaston, whose experience of perfect social entertainment was
      limited to that afforded by London drawing-rooms. &ldquo;If we had a rising
      tenor, there would be no difficulty about these people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, I suppose not,&rdquo; said the bishop. &ldquo;But I was thinking, Algernon,
      that if you would allow your pictures to be hung for the evening, and
      explain them, you know, it would be interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, by lamplight? They are not drop-scenes of a theatre, let me remind
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; but you see your theories of explanation would be understood by
      our good friends as well by lamplight as by daylight, and I am sure every
      one would be greatly interested.&rdquo; Mr. Glaston promised his father to think
      over the matter, and his father expressed his gratitude for this
      concession. &ldquo;And as for myself,&rdquo; continued the bishop, giving his hands
      the least little rub together, &ldquo;I would suggest reading a few notes on a
      most important subject, to which I have devoted some attention lately. My
      notes I would propose heading 'Observations on Phenomena of Automatic
      Cerebration amongst some of the Cannibal Tribes of the Salamander
      Archipelago.' I have some excellent specimens of skulls illustrative of
      the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Glaston looked at his father for a considerable time without speaking;
      at last he said quietly, &ldquo;I think I had better show my pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my paper&mdash;my notes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said the young man, rising. &ldquo;Utterly Impossible;&rdquo; and he
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop felt slightly hurt by his son's manner. He had treasured up his
      notes on the important observations he had made in an interesting part of
      his diocese, and he had looked forward with anxiety to a moment when he
      could reveal the result of his labours to the world, and yet his son had,
      when the opportunity presented itself, declared the revelation impossible.
      The bishop felt slightly hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, he had got over his grievance, and he was able to smile as
      usual upon each of his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner-party was small and select. There were two judges present, one
      of whom brought his wife and a daughter. Then there were two members of
      the Legislative Council, one with a son, the other with a daughter; a
      clergyman who had attained to the dizzy ecclesiastical eminence of a
      colonial deanery, and his partner in the dignity of his office. The
      Macnamara and Standish were there, and Mr. Harwood, together with the Army
      Boot Commissioner and Mrs. Crawford, the last of whom arrived with Colonel
      Gerald and Daireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford had been right. The bishop was charmed with Daireen, and so
      expressed himself while he took her hand in his and gave her the
      benediction of a smile. Poor Standish, seeing her so lovely as she was
      standing there, felt his soul full of love and devotion. What was all the
      rest of the world compared with her, he thought; the aggregate beauty of
      the universe, including the loveliness of the Miss Van der Veldt who was
      in the drawing-room, was insignificant by the side of a single curl of
      Daireen's wonderful hair. Mr. Harwood looked towards her also, but his
      thoughts were somewhat more complicated than those of Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not Daireen perfection?&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Crawford to Algernon Glaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop's son glanced at the girl critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand that band of black velvet with a pearl in front of
      it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel it to be a mistake&mdash;yes, it is an error for
      which I am sorry; I begin to fear it was designed only as a bold contrast.
      It is sad&mdash;very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford was chilled. She had never seen Daireen look so lovely. She
      felt for more than a moment that she was all unmeet for a wife, so
      child-like she seemed. And now the terrible thought suggested itself to
      Mrs. Crawford: what if Mr. Glaston's opinion was, after all, fallible?
      might it be possible that his judgment could be in error? The very
      suggestion of such a thought sent a cold thrill of fear through her. No,
      no: she would not admit such a possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was proceeded with, after the fashion of most dinners, in a
      highly satisfactory manner. The guests were arranged with discrimination
      in accordance with a programme of Mrs. Crawford's, and the conversation
      was unlimited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much to the dissatisfaction of The Macnamara the men went to the
      drawing-room before they had remained more than ten minutes over their
      claret. One of the young ladies of the colony had been induced to sing
      with the judge's son a certain duet called &ldquo;La ci darem la mano;&rdquo; and this
      was felt to be extremely agreeable by every one except the bishop's son.
      The bishop thanked the young lady very much, and then resumed his
      explanation to a group of his guests of the uses of some implements of war
      and agriculture brought from the tribes of the Salamander Archipelago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of the pictures of Mr. Glaston's collection were hung in the room,
      the most important being that marvellous Aholibah: it was placed upon a
      small easel at the farthest end of the room, a lamp being at each side. A
      group had gathered round the picture, and Mr. Glaston with the utmost
      goodnature repeated the story of its creation. Daireen had glanced towards
      the picture, and again that little shudder came over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting in the centre of the room upon an ottoman beside Mrs.
      Crawford and Mr. Harwood. Standish was in a group at the lower end, while
      his father was demonstrating how infinitely superior were the weapons
      found in the bogs of Ireland to the Salamander specimens. The bishop moved
      gently over to Daireen and explained to her the pleasure it would be
      giving every one in the room if she would consent to sing something.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once Daireen rose and went to the piano. A song came to her lips as she
      laid her hand upon the keys of the instrument, and her pure earnest voice
      sang the words that came back to her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From my life the light has waned:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Every golden gleam that shone
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Through the dimness now has gone:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of all joys has one remained?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Stays one gladness I have known?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Day is past; I stand, alone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Here beneath these darkened skies,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Asking&mdash;&ldquo;Doth a star arise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She ended with a passion that touched every one who heard her, and then
      there was a silence for some moments, before the door of the room was
      pushed open to the wall, and a voice said, &ldquo;Bravo, my dear, bravo!&rdquo; in no
      weak tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes turned towards the door. Mr. Despard entered, wearing an ill-made
      dress-suit, with an enormous display of shirt-front, big studs, and a
      large rose in his button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stayed outside till the song was over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bless your souls,
      I've got a feeling for music, and hang me if I've heard anything that
      could lick that tune.&rdquo; Then he nodded confidentially to the bishop. &ldquo;What
      do you say, Bishop? What do you say, King? am I right or wrong? Why, we're
      all here&mdash;all of our set&mdash;the colonel too&mdash;how are you,
      Colonel?&mdash;and the editor&mdash;how we all do manage to meet somehow!
      Birds of a feather&mdash;you know. Make yourselves at home, don't mind
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly up the room smiling rather more broadly than the bishop
      was in the habit of doing, on all sides. He did not stop until he was
      opposite the picture of Aholibah on the easel. Here he did stop. He seemed
      to be even more appreciative of pictorial art than of musical. He bent
      forward, gazing into that picture, regardless of the embarrassing silence
      there was in the room while every one looked towards him. He could not see
      how all eyes were turned upon him, so absorbed had he become before that
      picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop was now certainly not smiling. He walked slowly to the man's
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the bishop, &ldquo;you have chosen an inopportune time for a visit.
      I must beg of you to retire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the man seemed to be recalled to consciousness. He glanced up from
      the picture and looked into the bishop's face. He pointed with one hand to
      the picture, and then threw himself back in a chair with a roar of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens, this is a bigger surprise than seeing Oswin himself,&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Where is Oswin?&mdash;not here?&mdash;he should be here&mdash;he
      must see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Harwood's voice that said, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean, Mr. Editor?&rdquo; said Despard. &ldquo;Mean? Haven't I told you what I mean?
      By heavens, I forgot that I was at the Cape&mdash;I thought I was still in
      Melbourne! Good, by Jingo, and all through looking at that bit of paint!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself, sir?&rdquo; said Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;That there explains itself. Look at that
      picture. The woman in that picture is Oswin Markham's wife, the Italian he
      brought to Australia, where he left her. That's plain enough. A deucedly
      fine woman she is, though they never did get on together. Hallo! What's
      the matter with Missy there? My God! she's going to faint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Daireen Gerald did not faint. Her father had his arm about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she whispered faintly,&mdash;&ldquo;Papa, take me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald. &ldquo;Do not look like that. For God's sake,
      Daireen, don't look like that.&rdquo; They were standing outside waiting for the
      carriage to come up; for Daireen had walked from the room without
      faltering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not mind me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am strong&mdash;yes&mdash;very&mdash;very
      strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her into the carriage, and was at the point of entering himself,
      when the figure of Mrs. Crawford appeared among the palm plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, George! what is the meaning of this?&rdquo; she said in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; cried Colonel Gerald sternly. &ldquo;Go back! This is some more of
      your work. You shall never see my child again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the carriage. The major's wife was left standing in the
      porch thunderstruck at such a reproach coming from the colonel. Was this
      the reward of her labour&mdash;to stand among the palms, listening to the
      passing away of the carriage wheels?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the Dutch cottage had been reached that Daireen, in the
      darkness of the room, laid her head upon her father's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she whispered again, &ldquo;take me home&mdash;let us go home together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, you are at home now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa, I don't mean that; I mean home&mdash;I home&mdash;Glenmara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Daireen: we shall go away from here. We shall be happy together
      in the old house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Happy&mdash;happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; said the <i>maître d'hôtel</i>, referring to a
      question put to him by Despard, who had been brought away from the
      bishop's house by Harwood in a diplomatically friendly manner. &ldquo;What do
      you mean? Didn't Mr. Markham tell you he was going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going&mdash;where?&rdquo; said Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Natal, sir? I felt sure that he had told you, though he didn't speak
      to us. Yes, he left in the steamer for Natal two hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squaring everything?&rdquo; asked Despard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the <i>maître</i>; &ldquo;Mr. Markham was a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was half a sovereign he gave you then,&rdquo; remarked Despard. Then turning
      to Harwood, he said: &ldquo;Well, Mr. Editor, this is the end of all, I fancy.
      We can't expect much after this. He's gone now, and I'm infernally sorry
      for him, for Oswin was a good sort. By heavens, didn't I burst in on the
      bishop's party like a greased shrapnel? I had taken a little better than a
      glass of brandy before I went there, so I was in good form. Yes, Paulina
      is the name of his wife. He had picked her up in Italy or thereabouts.
      That's what made his friends send him off to Australia. He was punished
      for his sins, for that woman made his life a hell to him. Now we'll take
      the tinsel off a bottle of Moët together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harwood; &ldquo;not to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the room and went upstairs, for now indeed this psychological
      analyst had an intricate problem to work out. It was a long time before he
      was able to sleep.

      to be told to complete the story of the few months of the lives of the
      people whose names have appeared in these pages in illustration of how
      hardly things go right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that night, after the bishop's little dinnerparty, every one, except
      Mr. Despard, seemed to have a bitter consciousness of how terribly astray
      things had gone. It seemed hopeless to think that anything could possibly
      be made right again. If Mrs. Crawford had not been a pious woman and a
      Christian, she would have been inclined to say that the Fates, which had
      busied themselves with the disarrangement of her own carefully constructed
      plans, had become inebriated with their success and were wantoning in the
      confusion of the mortals who had been their playthings. Should any one
      have ventured to interpret her thoughts after this fashion, however, Mrs.
      Crawford would have been indignant and would have assured her accuser that
      her only thought was how hardly things go right. And perhaps, indeed, the
      sum of her thoughts could not have been expressed by words of fuller
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been careful beyond all her previous carefulness that her plans
      for the future of Daireen Gerald should be arranged so as to insure their
      success; and yet, what was the result of days of thoughtfulness and
      unwearying toil, she asked herself as she was driving homeward under the
      heavy oak branches amongst which a million fire-flies were flitting. This
      feeling of defeat&mdash;nay, even of shame, for the words Colonel Gerald
      had spoken to her in his bitterness of spirit were still in her mind&mdash;was
      this the result of her care, her watchfulness, her skill of organisation?
      Truly Mrs. Crawford felt that she had reason for thinking herself
      ill-treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; she said solemnly to the Army Boot Commissioner as he partook of
      some simple refreshment in the way of brandy and water before retiring for
      the night&mdash;&ldquo;Major, listen to me while I tell you that I wash my hands
      clear of these people. Daireen Gerald has disappointed me; she has made a
      fool both of herself and of me; and George Gerald grossly insulted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he really now?&rdquo; said the major compassionately, as he added another
      thimbleful of the contents of the bottle to his tumbler. &ldquo;Upon my soul it
      was too bad of George&mdash;a devilish deal too bad of him.&rdquo; Here the
      major emptied his tumbler. He was feeling bitterly the wrong done to his
      wife as he yawned and searched in the dimness for a cheroot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wash my hands clear of them all,&rdquo; continued the lady. &ldquo;The bishop is a
      poor thing to allow himself to be led by that son of his, and the son is a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake take care, Kate; a bishop, you know, is not like the rest
      of the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a weak thing, I say,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Crawford firmly. &ldquo;And his son
      is&mdash;a&mdash;puppy. But I have done with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>for</i> them,&rdquo; said the major, striking a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that Mrs. Crawford relieved her pent-up feelings as she went
      to her bed; but in spite of the disappointment Daireen had caused her, and
      the gross insult she had received from Daireen's father, before she went
      to sleep she had asked herself if it might not be well to forgive George
      Gerald and to beg of him to show some additional attention to Mr. Harwood,
      who was, all things considered, a most deserving man, besides being a
      distinguished person and a clever. Yes, she thought that this would be a
      prudent step for Colonel Gerald to take at once. If Daireen had made a
      mistake, it was sad, to be sure, but there was no reason why it might not
      be retrieved, Mrs. Crawford felt; and she fell asleep without any wrath in
      her heart against her old friend George Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Arthur Harwood, as he stood in his room at the hotel and looked out to
      the water of Table Bay, had the truth very strongly forced upon him that
      things had gone far wrong indeed, and with a facility of error that was
      terrifying. He felt that he alone could fully appreciate how terribly
      astray everything had gone. He saw in a single glance all of the past; and
      his scrupulously just conscience did not fail to give him credit for
      having at least surmised something of the truth that had just been brought
      to light. From the first&mdash;even before he had seen the man&mdash;he
      had suspected Oswin Markham; and, subsequently, had he not perceived&mdash;or
      at any rate fancied that he perceived&mdash;something of the feeling that
      existed between Markham and Daireen?
    </p>
    <p>
      His conscience gave him ample credit for his perception; but after all,
      this was an unsatisfactory set-off against the weight of his reflections
      on the subject of the general error of affairs that concerned him closely,
      not the least of which was the unreasonable conduct of the Zulu monarch
      who had rejected the British ultimatum, and who thus necessitated the
      presence of a special correspondent in his dominions. Harwood, seeing the
      position of everything at a glance, had come to the conclusion that it
      would be impossible for him, until some months had passed, to tell Daireen
      all that he believed was in his heart. He knew that she had loved that man
      whom she had saved from death, and who had rewarded her by behaving as a
      ruffian towards her; still Mr. Harwood, like Mrs. Crawford, felt that her
      mistake was not irretrievable. But if he himself were now compelled by the
      conduct of this wretched savage to leave Cape Town for an indefinite
      period, how should he have an opportunity of pointing out to Daireen the
      direction in which her happiness lay? Mr. Harwood was not generously
      disposed towards the Zulu monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon descending to the coffee-room in the morning, he found Mr. Despard
      sitting somewhat moodily at the table. Harwood was beginning to think, now
      that Mr. Despard's mission in life had been performed, there could be no
      reason why his companionship should be sought. But Mr. Despard was not at
      all disposed to allow his rapidly conceived friendship for Harwood to be
      cut short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Mr. Editor, you're down at last, are you?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The colonel
      didn't go up to, your room, you bet, though he did to me&mdash;fine old
      boy is he, by my soul&mdash;plenty of good work in him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The colonel? Was Colonel Gerald here?&rdquo; asked Harwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was, Mr. Editor; he was here just to see me, and have a friendly
      morning chat. We've taken to each other, has the colonel and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He heard that Markham had gone? You told him, no doubt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Editor, sir,&rdquo; said Despard, rising to his feet and keeping himself
      comparatively steady by grasping the edge of the table,&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Editor,
      there are things too sacred to be divulged even to the Press. There are
      feelings&mdash;emotions&mdash;chords of the human heart&mdash;you know all
      that sort of thing&mdash;the bond of friendship between the colonel and me
      is something like that. What I told him will never be divulged while I'm
      sober. Oswin had his faults, no doubt, but for that matter I have mine.
      Which of us is perfect, Mr. Editor? Why, here's this innocent-looking lad
      that's coming to me with another bottle of old Irish, hang me if he isn't
      a walking receptacle of bribery and corruption! What, are you off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood was off, nor did he think if necessary to go through the
      formality of shaking hands with the moraliser at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the day following that Mrs. Crawford called at Colonel Gerald's
      cottage at Mowbray. She gave a start when she saw that the little hall was
      blocked up with packing-cases. One of them was an old military camp-box,
      and upon the end of it was painted in dimly white letters the name
      &ldquo;Lieutenant George Gerald.&rdquo; Seeing it now as she had often seen it in the
      days at the Indian station, the poor old campaigner sat down on a tin
      uniform-case and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, dear good Kate,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald, laying his hand on her
      shoulder. &ldquo;What is the matter, my dear girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, George, George!&rdquo; sobbed the lady, &ldquo;look at that case there&mdash;look
      at it, and think of the words you spoke to me two nights ago. Oh, George,
      George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me, Kate, I was unjust&mdash;ungenerous. Oh, Kate, you do not
      know how I had lost myself as the bitter truth was forced upon me. You
      have forgiven me long ago, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, George,&rdquo; she said, putting her hand in his. &ldquo;God knows I have
      forgiven you. But what is the meaning of this? You are not going away,
      surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We leave by the mail to-morrow, Kate,&rdquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, is it so bad as that?&rdquo; asked the lady, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad? there is nothing bad now, my dear. We only feel&mdash;Dolly and
      myself&mdash;that we must have a few months together amongst our native
      Irish mountains before we set out for the distant Castaways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford looked into his face earnestly for some moments. &ldquo;Poor
      darling little Dolly,&rdquo; she said in a voice full of compassion; &ldquo;she has
      met with a great grief, but I pray that all may yet be well. I will not
      see her now, but I will say farewell to her aboard the steamer to-morrow.
      Give her my love, George. God knows how dear she is to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gerald put his arms about his old friend and kissed her silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the afternoon of the next day the crowd about the stern of the mail
      steamer which was at the point of leaving for England was very large. But
      it is only necessary to refer to a few of the groups on the deck. Colonel
      Gerald and his old friend Major Crawford were side by side, while Daireen
      and the major's wife were standing apart looking together up to the curved
      slopes of the tawny Lion's Head that half hid the dark, flat face of Table
      Mountain. Daireen was pale almost to whiteness, and as her considerate
      friend said some agreeable words to her she smiled faintly, but the
      observant Standish felt that her smile was not real, it was only a phantom
      of the smiles of the past which had lived upon her face. Standish was
      beside his father, who had been so fortunate as to obtain the attention of
      Mr. Harwood for the story of the wrongs he had suffered through the sale
      of his property in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there left for me in the counthry of my sires that bled?&rdquo; he
      inquired with an emphasis that almost amounted to passion. &ldquo;The sthrangers
      that have torn the land away from us thrample us into the dust. No, sir,
      I'll never return to be thrampled upon; I'll go with my son to the land of
      our exile&mdash;the distant Castaway isles, where the flag of freedom may
      yet burn as a beacon above the thunderclouds of our enemies. Return to the
      land that has been torn from us? Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standish, who could have given a very good guess as to the number of The
      Macnamara's creditors awaiting his return with anxiety, if not impatience,
      moved away quickly, and Daireen noticed his action. She whispered a word
      to Mrs. Crawford, and in another instant she and Standish were together.
      She gave him her hand, and each looked into the other's face speechlessly
      for a few moments. On her face there was a faint tender smile, but his was
      full of passionate entreaty, the force of which made his eyes tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Standish, dear old Standish,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you alone seem good and noble
      and true. You will not forget all the happy days we have had together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget them?&rdquo; said Standish. &ldquo;Oh, Daireen, if you could but know all&mdash;if
      you could but know how I think of every day we have passed together. What
      else is there in the world worth thinking about? Oh, Daireen, you know
      that I have always thought of you only&mdash;that I will always think of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Standish,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Do not say anything to me&mdash;no,
      nothing&mdash;yet. But you will write every week, and tell me how the
      Castaway people are getting on, until we come out to you at the islands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daireen, do all the days we have passed together at home&mdash;on the
      lough&mdash;on the mountain, go for nothing?&rdquo; he cried almost sadly. &ldquo;Oh,
      my darling, surely we cannot part in this way. Your life is not wrecked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not wrecked,&rdquo; she said with a start, and he knew she was
      struggling to be strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be happy, Daireen, you will indeed, after a while. And you will
      give me a word of hope now&mdash;one little word to make me happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him&mdash;tearfully&mdash;lovingly. &ldquo;Dear Standish, I can
      only give you one word. Will it comfort you at all if I say <i>Hope</i>,
      Standish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, my love! I knew it would come right in the end. The world I
      knew could not be so utterly forsaken by God but that everything should
      come right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only one word I have given you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a word, Daireen! oh, the dearest and best word I ever heard
      breathed. God bless you, darling! God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not make any attempt to kiss her: he only held her white hand
      tightly for an instant and looked into her pure, loving eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my boy, good-bye,&rdquo; said Colonel Gerald, laying his hand upon
      Standish's shoulder. &ldquo;You will leave next week for the Castaways, and you
      will, I know, be careful to obey to the letter the directions of those in
      command until I come out to you. You must write a complete diary, as I
      told you&mdash;ah, there goes the gun! Daireen, here is Mr. Harwood
      waiting to shake hands with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harwood's hand was soon in the girl's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Miss Gerald. I trust you will sometimes give me a thought,&rdquo; he
      said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget you, Mr. Harwood,&rdquo; she said as she returned his
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another instant, as it seemed to the group on the shore, the good
      steamer passing out of the bay had dwindled down to that white piece of
      linen which a little hand waved over the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harwood,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford, as the special correspondent brought
      the major's wife to a wagonette,&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Harwood, I fear we have been
      terribly wrong. But indeed all the wrong was not mine. You, I know, will
      not blame me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blame you, Mrs. Crawford? Do not think of such a thing,&rdquo; said Harwood.
      &ldquo;No; no one is to blame. Fate was too much for both of us, Mrs. Crawford.
      But all is over now. All the past days with her near us are now no more
      than pleasant memories. I go round to Natal in two days, and then to my
      work in the camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Harwood, what ruffians there are in this world!&rdquo; said the lady
      just before they parted. Mr. Harwood smiled his acquiescence. His own
      experience in the world had led him to arrive unassisted at a similar
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Harwood kept his work and left by the steamer for Natal two days
      afterwards; and in the same steamer Mr. Despard took passage also,
      declaring his intention to enlist on the side of the Zulus. Upon reaching
      Algoa Bay, however, he went ashore and did not put in an appearance at the
      departure of the steamer from the port; so that Mr. Harwood was deprived
      of his companionship, which had hitherto been pretty close, but which
      promised to become even more so. As there was in the harbour a small
      vessel about to proceed to Australia, the anxiety of the special
      correspondent regarding the future of the man never reached a point of
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next week Standish Macnamara, accompanied by his father, left for the
      Castaway Islands, where he was to take up his position as secretary to the
      new governor of the sunny group. Standish was full of eagerness to begin
      his career of hard and noble work in the world. He felt that there would
      be a large field for the exercise of his abilities in the Castaways, and
      with the word that Daireen had given him living in his heart to inspire
      all his actions, he felt that there was nothing too hard for him to
      accomplish, even to compelling his father to return to Ireland before six
      months should have passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on a cool afternoon towards the end of this week, that Mrs.
      Crawford was walking under the trees in the gardens opposite Government
      House, when she heard a pleasant little musical laugh behind her,
      accompanied by the pat of dainty little high-heeled shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, good Mrs. Crawford, why will you walk so terribly fast? It quite
      took away the breath of poor little me to follow you,&rdquo; came the voice of
      Lottie Vincent Mrs. Crawford turned, and as she was with a friend, she
      could not avoid allowing her stout hand to be touched by one of Lottie's
      ten-buttoned gloves. &ldquo;Ah, you are surprised to see me,&rdquo; continued the
      young lady. &ldquo;I am surprised myself to find myself here, but papa would not
      hear of my remaining at Natal when he went on to the frontier with the
      regiment, so I am staying with a friend in Cape Town. Algernon is here,
      but the dear boy is distressed by the number of people. Poor Algy is so
      sensitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor who?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good gracious, what have I said?&rdquo; exclaimed the artless little thing,
      blushing very prettily, and appearing as tremulous as a fluttered dove.
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Mrs. Crawford, I never thought of concealing it from you for
      a moment. I meant to tell you the first of any one in the world&mdash;I
      did indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell me what?&rdquo; asked the major's wife sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you know that the dear good bishop has given his consent to&mdash;to&mdash;do
      help me out of my difficulty of explaining, Mrs. Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your becoming the wife of his son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would not ask me to say it all so terribly plainly,&rdquo; said
      Lottie. &ldquo;Ah yes, dear Algy was too importunate for poor little me to
      resist; I pitied him and promised to become his for ever. We are devoted
      to each other, for there is no bond so fast as that of artistic sympathy,
      Mrs. Crawford. I meant to write and thank you for your dear good-natured
      influence, which, I know, brought about his proposal. It was all due, I
      frankly acknowledge, to your kindness in bringing us together upon the day
      of that delightful lunch we had at the grove of silver leaves. How can I
      ever thank you? But there is darling Algy looking quite bored. I must rush
      to him,&rdquo; she continued, as she saw Mrs. Crawford about to speak. Lottie
      did not think it prudent to run the risk of hearing Mrs. Crawford refer to
      certain little Indian affairs connected with Lottie's residence at that
      agreeable station on the Himalayas; so she kissed the tips of her gloves,
      and tripped away to where Mr. Algernon Glaston was sitting on one of the
      garden seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a wicked girl,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crawford to her companion. &ldquo;She has at
      last succeeded in finding some one foolish enough to be entrapped by her.
      Never mind, she has conquered&mdash;I admit that. Oh, this world, this
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there can hardly be a doubt that Miss Lottie Vincent, all things
      considered, might be said to have conquered. She was engaged to marry
      Algernon Glaston, the son of the Bishop of the Calapash Islands and
      Metropolitan of the Salamander Group, and this to Lottie meant conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Oswin Markham only a few words need be spoken to close this story, such
      as it is. Oswin Markham was once more seen by Harwood. Two months after
      the outbreak of the war the special correspondent, in the exercise of his
      duty, was one night riding by the Tugela, where a fierce engagement had
      taken place between the Zulus and the British troops. The dead, black and
      white, were lying together&mdash;assagai and rifle intermixed. Harwood
      looked at the white upturned faces of the dead men that the moonlight made
      more ghastly, and amongst those faces he saw the stern clear-cut features
      of Oswin Markham. He was in the uniform of a Natal volunteer. Harwood gave
      a start, but only one; he stood above the dead man for a long time, lost
      in his own thoughts. Then the pioneers, who were burying the dead, came
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor wretch, poor wretch!&rdquo; he said slowly, standing there in the
      moonlight. &ldquo;Poor wretch!... If she had never seen him... if... Poor
      child!&rdquo;

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
